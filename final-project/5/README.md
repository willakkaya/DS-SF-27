## PROMPT

This is it!  It's presentation time.

Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom won't know anything about data science!  That's why it's important to practice communicating clearly and effectively so that anyone can understand.

Your goal here is to create a 10- to 15-minute presentation that guides your viewers through the problem, original data and hypothesis, findings, and results.  This is what you've been building toward over the past few weeks!  You should already have the analytical work complete, so now it's time to clean up and clarify your findings.

Come up with a detailed 10- to 20-slide deck or interactive demo that explains your data, visualizes your model, describes your approach, articulates strengths and weaknesses, and presents specific recommendations.  Allow for 3-5 minutes of QA; be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience!

**Objective:** A detailed 10- to 20-slide presentation deck that relates your data, model, and findings to a non-technical audience.

## DELIVERABLES

### Final Presentation

**Requirements:**

- Include project table of content, background, problem, and hypothesis.
- Describe dataset and analysis with summary and charts.
- Demonstrate your model with visualizations.
- Review the conclusions from your findings.
- Create a list of recommendations and next steps based on your work.
- Frame your materials for a non-technical audience.
- Include an appendix with full technical details

Some ideas on how to break down your presentation:

- *Outline* 
  - What is your project about?
  - What is its history?
  - What relevant information is required for a colleague to jump in to understand your project?
- *Summary*  (including data and problem statement)
  - What were you trying to accomplish?
  - What steps did your project take?
  - Where did the data come from?  What does a sample look like?  Was there data you considered but decided to remove?
- *Modeling Insight* 
  - What is the visualization explaining?
  - What do the `x` and `y` axis mean?
  - How does the visualization help either prove or disprove your work?
  - What caveats have to be explained to best understand it?
- *Modeling Approach* 
  - What was your model trying to optimize for?  Why was it the right metric for optimization?
  - What algorithm did you try?  How does it work?
- *2-3 Results* 
  - What worked?  What didn't?  Why?
- *Conclusion* 
  - What had the most impact on your work?
  - What can you confirm?  What can you suggest?  What is still to be determined?
- *ext Steps* 
  - What should this project do moving forward?
  - What would be the next two or three things you want to try?  What impact might they have?
  - What might your conclusions enable others to do?

## RESOURCES

### Starter Code

- Refer to the [presentation template](../2/template.md) as a blueprint for how to organize your work.

### Suggestions for Getting Started

- A quick outline (e.g., "what do I need" and "where can I find it") can help you prepare.
- Practice your presentation with a friend or family member! Outside feedback can help you identify gaps in your material.

### Specific Tips

- Limit the amount of visuals and text on your slides for maximum clarity.
  - E.g., try not to use more than 2 visuals or 3-5 bullets per slide.
- Clean & informative presentations > Fancy Presentations!
- Keep your charts simple, and make sure they are clearly labeled.

- [`seaborn`](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/aesthetics.html#scaling-plot-elements-with-plotting-context-and-set-context) has a handy easy way to set figures into a "talk" context, which blows up the text and makes it easier to read.
