## DELIVERABLES

### Completed Jupyter Notebook

- **Requirements:**
  - Create one-hot encoding using binary variables.
  - Calculate odds ratios by hand.
  - Complete a logistic regression using `statsmodels` and interpret your findings.
  - Calculate predicted probabilities.
  - Do a similar analysis using `sklearn`.

## RESOURCES

### Dataset

The dataset is available [here](../dataset).

### Starter code

Review the questions in the [starter code notebook](./code/unit-project-3-starter-code.ipynb) provided.

### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Review logistic regression, odds ratios and probabilities from prior lessons.
- **Read the documenation for `statsmodels` and `sklearn`.**  Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow; learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a data scientist.
