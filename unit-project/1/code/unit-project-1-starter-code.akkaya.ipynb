Based on our current process which applicants are more likely to be accepted into UCLA? Are we able to predict which applicants will be accepted soley based on these three variables GRE scores, GPA and alma mater prestigious scores (1 = most presigious, 4 = least presitigous)? Are there other factors aside from the variables listed that can determine acceptance status ? The goal of our analysis will to try and answer all of these questions. "
