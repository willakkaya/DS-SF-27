Allen","I'm not sure what I can add, but here's my review for this Devastating Masterpiece","Ahh, I think I've been avoiding this review.In two words, I would say this book is &#34;Devastating Masterpiece.&#34; It's devastating. It's brilliant. And, oh, by the way, it is NOTHING like Harry Potter.As I've said to many people since finishing the book, it's best to think about this as by a different author altogether. Trying to put the Rowling-you-know into this book just creates a disjointedness that is hard to reconcile. Take it separately.Rowling has a knack for characters. I really don't know how she does it. She has created a world of peoples inside this tiny English village abutting a city that you feel like you know. The &#34;main characters&#34; range in age from their mid-teens to their mid-sixties or seventies... And they're all just as believable as the next. And they are all so very very flawed.Superficially, this book is about someone dying in this small town in England, leaving open a vacancy in the town government. What happens next is a whirlwind of activity as the two &#34;sides&#34; in the town vie for the open seat.In this book, you name it and Rowling's probably covered it.  Assuming what you're naming is dark and desperate. While I disagree that she felt the need to &#34;prove herself&#34; by covering so much hard and gritty ground, as some reviewers had suggested, it did almost feel at times as if the darker side of life was fighting to get out, and it all landed in this book.  I mean, seriously: drugs, sex, rape, adultery, jealousy, hatred, fear, abuse, etc. It's there.Nevertheless, somehow Rowing creates a story about the human condition of hope. With peoples you know. And in this normal, run-of-the-mill life story, extraordinary circumstances occur. Brilliant. Devastating. Hopeful.FOUR AND A HALF of five stars (but inching toward 5, so 5 on those sites w/o half stars :))",5,"06 20, 2014",1403222400,"[0, 0]"

No one seems to learn their lessons. Maybe I am not looking ""deep"" enough. Also would not let a child or teenager read this. Very strong language, sex, drugs, rape and abuse.",1,"10 1, 2012",1349049600,"[13, 27]"
"0316228532","A3DGB4HN3QCGAL","A. Burchfield","The name of the author sold lots of copies!","I seriously considered buying this book just on the strength of the author's reputation as the writer of the Harry Potter series- I'm glad that I didn't. The &#34;Potter&#34; books were very long but easily readable, this book, by the same author- is something else.I first read a couple of &#34;free&#34; chapters in e-book form and then checked out a hardback copy at my local library- if I didn't know better I'd say I had books by two completely different authors.While I could sit down and easily read 100 pages of any &#34;Harry&#34; book in one sitting two chapters of &#34;Casual Vacancy&#34; is real work. Both &#34;Harry&#34; and &#34;Casual&#34; are very British in character so it isn't that. I think the author must've adopted a somewhat different writing style this time around- every time I've picked this book up I just couldn't make myself care about any of the characters. It seemed like the author just wrote down whatever flowed out of her mind without working so hard to develop anything.A lot of unpleasant characters, more sex and &#34;cussing&#34; than in a Tom Clancy or other adult adventure novel (and in some of those I do manage to care about somebody), &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; was not for me at all. Plenty of people have given 5 star reviews but so many more have given less- some of us much less. Not a book for the kids or a lot of other readers.If you haven't read it yet, get a copy at the library first- and if you're like me you'll find yourself thinking you'll wait to find a discounted, very much so, paperback copy in a flea market or garage sale.

"0316228532","A2HFCSZC3GCXSQ","A. Carter","No Fancy Review...just my humble opinion.","Ok Folks, from a housewife who just loves to read.....here is MY simple review of The Casual Vacancy.  I really enjoyed it.  I found it very thought provoking and real.  It is a look into the lives of several families who are affected by the death of a prominent counsel member.  J. K. Rowling created well rounded characters and intertwined them beautifully.  Sometimes I thought the book was funny, sometimes it was sad, sometimes confusing, shocking, and while some reviewers felt that the end was predictable, I did not see it coming.  I enjoyed seeing the characters evolve, even though it took them, especially the adults, to the END of the book to make positive changes.  I found the story line very real and dealing with issues that are happening in todays world.  I read that many of the reviewers found it too dark and depressing, and felt that J. K. Rowling was attempting to be edgy by throwing in all of these hot button issues....I disagree with that.  The issues in this book, found in this community, are issues found in most communities whether one cares to believe that or not.I suppose this type of book is not for everyone.  If you are the type of person who wants a clear cut story, idea, and an answer at the end, If you want it all spelled out for you then don't waste your time.  If you are the type of person who is a people watcher, who enjoys studying the human condition, and stretching yourself then you will certainly feel rewarded for reading The Casual Vacancy.",4,"12 2, 2013",1385942400,"[0, 0]"
"0316228532","A2M3WZ9GVIMCBZ","Acorn","Well written and engaging","The difference between JK Rowling and many other authors to find success in print and screen is this: JK Rowling can actually write. The Casual Vacancy is not the page-turner that Harry Potter was, but it's still engaging. You feel for the characters and care about what will happen to them. Each has a complexity that you don't expect, making the book fascinating, even if the story is a little boring. Her use of the English language makes you wish you had paid attention to your Word of the Day calendar, and serves as a reminder to be grateful for the Kindle's built-in dictionary.",3,"11 5, 2012",1352073600,"[1, 1]"
"0316228532","A3D0NZJHMX9RMI","A. Fleming","Fascinating, well-written story - difficult to put down once you start","While the storyline for this book is completely different in every way from the Harry Potter series, Rowling's pure writing talent shines through as stromg as ever. She takes a narrative that, in the hands of anyone else, would be boring (small town politics and gossip) and makes it fascinating and difficult to put down. Barry Fairbrother is the character who dies at the very beginning, setting off the events of the book. And yet...Rowling makes you care about him, a character you barely meet. She makes you care about all of the inhabitants of the town, and makes you see the motivations and passions driving all of them - there is no objective right or wrong in this little world of Pagford, no true good or evil. It must be said, however, that Rowling does not gloss over harsh realities of life here.The one flaw I found with this book is e sheer number of &#34;main&#34; characters. I am not great with names, so it took a little time before I was truly engaged in the story because it took a while to figure out who was who. Once I did, I was very glad I stuck with it.I definitely recommend this book to any reader of modern fiction, but if you are interested solely because of her past works and not her style and talent in general, you will be disappointed.",4,"10 20, 2013",1382227200,"[0, 0]"

I saw this in a display and thought ""...Wow, she wrote the Harry Potter series, my daughter Ophelia would love this"".Anyway, I wrapped it up and gave it to her.Next thing I knew she asked me questions about drugs and sex..she said they were in the book I bought for her birthday.I feel that her childhood is gone now.This book should be sold BEHIND the counter so people know its not for children.How can we expect our children to grow up happy and healthy when filth is all around? ""Does America really have such a large number of prudes?Coming back to the book, let me add here that I interrupted my Booker Prize Shortlist Reading Challenge, to read 'The Casual Vacancy'. As I have been reading a lot of literary fiction, I can confidently say that 'The Casual Vacancy' is a literary book. It takes a master story teller to take snapshots of everyday life with all its ordinariness, ugliness, pain and heartbreak and weave into a page turning exciting read. In spite of all the prudes, Rowling has triumphed once again.I have a feeling that if this book had not come with the Rowling brand and had been written by someone like say Zadie Smith, the very people who have been criticising this book (the lit-critics) might have celebrated it.PS - I will be posting a detailed review once I have completed my Booker Reading Challenge.",5,"10 4, 2012",1349308800,"[6, 16]"

Jonsdottir","Very good book - must read","I have just finisthed reading Cacual Vacancy - one of the very best books I have read in a long time, and I read a lot.This book is a masterpiece and I encourage everyone who still have to read the book to read it with open mind.We all know that J.K. Rowling is one of the very best author ever, that she has proved with her Harry Potter books.Now Ms. Rowling takes on a very different subject.  The story takes place in a little town in England and we get to know very many characters.  I just loved how Ms. Rowling put all those different characters to live and how the story played out.  For me it is a book about parents who do not take good enough care of their children.  And although the parents are all VERY different they all neglect their children in different ways. This is also a book about race for power in this small community but first and foremost the book gives us many examples of narrow minded people who do not see the whole picture.  Some caracters grow as the story folds, but most of them are stuck in their own lives and do not have it in them to understand what a community is.  Some caracters are actually vicious and have no hope.  Some live in circumstances that they have little hope of improving themselves - and certanly not if not helped.  The end is sad, but some of the people have hope for better life, especially the young ones, I think.As said before I read a lot and I have to say here that one of the reason I liked this book so much is the vocabulary.Ms. Rowling ia a master with the English language and I was delighted with so many phrases and wording.This is a bit old fashioned books with lot of caracters and reminds me of the old English Classics - only it takes place today.When I bought this book, Kindle e-book, I read some reviews before I started reading the book.  Some vere good others gave this book a very poor rating.  I can not finish my review without mentioning that I find many of the 1-2 star ratings quiet offending as so many of them are based on that this book is not a Harry Potter book and therefore the readers were disappointed.  Some gave low ratings for the price.  OK the price is not low, but compared to books by other famous writers this book lies in the same price catagori.  Some gave low ratings as they did not like the book, that I can accept.I apologize for typos and prase of words - english is not my native language.",5,"10 21, 2012",1350777600,"[0, 0]"
"0316228532","A39PGE3IDI0VY6","A. KAPLAN ""Penelopecat""","A Portrait of Ordinary Lives","JK Rowling's first novel for adults is a complex, detailed portrait of an English village, told through the vehicle of a local election to fill the casual vacancy on the parish council left by the death of Barry Fairweather. Rowling has created a complete setting that feels very real, with a geography and history and society that make a concrete impression in the reader's mind. And she's populated it with a very diverse cast of characters (well, mostly white, if I'm honest, but diverse in background and personality) whose lives I really started to get wrapped up in.What it isn't is Harry Potter book eight, so if that's what you're looking for, you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for the same sort of detailed world-building found in the Potter books, however, you'll find that in spades. Only here, it's applied to the real world, not the fantastic.It's also not a clear-cut, straightforward tale with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Instead, it's a collection of the little moments that fill a particular period of time in a particular place. To a degree, it's got that in common with the Potter books as well, only here the small moments aren't broken up with epic battles against mythical creatures or snake-headed evil sorcerers. Make no mistake, however; this is still a book that tells a complete story. And it's a story that I found compelling and difficult to put down.I think that some fans may be disappointed at Rowling's shift from the epic to the everyday. And I don't know if that's an unfair feeling; up until now, being a JK Rowling fan was synonymous with being a Harry Potter fan. However, I hope those fans are reasonable enough to treat the book on its own merits, and acknowledge the difference between poor writing and unmet expectations. The writing here is every bit as good as her Harry Potter prose, only here it's in service to showing the small details of ordinary people living in an ordinary community. She hasn't suddenly gotten any more flowery or poetic, just more down to earth.I'm a fan of stories about communities, where disparate people lead disparate lives, and instead of focusing on one character or one event, we see the stories of their connections. This is very much that kind of book, so I really enjoyed it. Just don't try to skip ahead to the next Quiddich match, or your heart will be broken.",5,"10 5, 2012",1349395200,"[3, 8]"

"0316228532","A3NBL1TI2M3CW1","Alex C. Telander ""Alex C. Telander""","""The Casual Vacancy""","After the unfathomable success of the Harry Potter series, with over 450 million copies sold worldwide, likely making it one of the biggest phenomena of our lifetimes, J. K. Rowling is now back with her first new book in five years.  She now turns to a much more adult story about a quaint little English town where everything is most certainly not as it seems.In the idyllic west country town of Pagford, where things pass at their own pace and everything stays pretty much the same, a change is about to happen.  A respected citizen of the community, Barry Fairbrother suffers a sudden brain aneurysm and dies unexpectedly.  It is a very sad time for the family and for the community, as he touched many lives during his time, as well as being an important member of the town's council.  But Barry's passing is also the lighting of a spark that sets off an explosive chain reaction, as the empty space on the town council starts many wondering who should fill his seat, and a number of unlikely candidates come out of the woodwork.The Casual Vacancy is also the story about a number of the characters of this community, and how they begin to act and react when this person who had an effect on their lives is gone and is no longer there to provide aid and advice.  The book is by no means a happy novel, as these characters make terrible decisions that lead them down a downward spiral of despair.  By the end of the book, the reader is left hoping their might be some sort of cathartic uplift, but Rowling is going for a harsh true-to-life approach here, where things don't all of a sudden get magically better.Overall the book comes off as a letdown, slow and dragging at points, with nothing to drive the reader along to keep reading, as things get worse and worse for just about everyone it seems.  Rowling is perhaps pulling from some earlier experiences in her life before her fame and riches, as there are characters dealing with drug addiction, poverty, marital problems, and a whole host of unsavory issues.  The book also comes off somewhat amateurish, as Rowling constantly references many places throughout this imaginary town that confuse the reader, and could have easily been aided with a handy map at the beginning of the book.  Then there is the large host of characters, featuring many couples of about the same age, some even with the same first letters of their names, which often makes things confusing, and could've been helped with a simple cast list.  Finally, there is the constantly switching P.O.V. from paragraph to paragraph, without any break in between, so that the reader becomes quite untethered and lost at times.The Casual Vacancy was an experiment by Rowling in seeing what happens to a town when an important member dies and all the people he'd had an effect on begin making bad decisions that then effect the rest of the town.  By the end of the book the reader is sad over the events of the book, though Rowling makes it clear that if any of the characters had made the decision to not think of themselves for a moment and to notice that nearby person suffering and help them, things would have come out quite differently.  But because this social message is buried in the clunky format and pitfalls of the book with no satisfactory resolution, the reader is left wondering what was the point of reading this book to the last page.Originally written on January 8, 2013 Alex C.

Sure, there is no magic, or huge victories over evil by the side of good, but the writing is familiar and still just as powerful. The Casual Vacancy is not a happy book, it can be downright depressing, but it's an important book to read. If this book was not written by JK Rowling, it probably would not have been published, which is a real shame. Its an important story about something that is effecting most communities due to the bad economy and harsh austerity measure. The town of Pagford is a wealthy one and when Barry Fairbrother, a do-gooder on the local council dies, a fraction of people want to get rid of the poor district of Fields and the methadone clinic. Like what is happening in the UK and the US and all over, some people would rather let the little guy fend for himself rather than work together as a community to help out everyone. The characters in the book are very flawed. The reader might agree with the views expressed by one character but hate their actions in their private lives. The adults can be huge hypocrites and just down right nasty.JK Rowling is excellent writing about the lives of teenagers and the struggles they have with their parents. Even in the midst of domestic abuse, drug abuse, and rape, by the end there is a feeling of hope. There is a sense that things can change for the better because the next generation doesn't have the same hang-ups or prejudices as their parents.Like I and many have said, it's not an easy book, its gritty and messy, and its real life.",5,"10 1, 2012",1349049600,"[12, 19]"

Pagford is about as far from Hogwarts as it is possible to get; Rowling wastes no opportunity to describe all that is seamy about provincial life with its petty politics and parochialism, crime and grime; the mundane and the inane of small-town England. From a protracted flight of inspired fancy her imagination has plummeted to the slimy underbelly of life.Her characters are uber earth-bound, over- burdened by neuroses, guilty secrets and personal agendas; they are multi-flawed rather than multi-faceted; the human palette is less of light and shade than of shade and gloom, but it is not the less interesting for that. I found myself drawn into their stories much as one is drawn into one of the seedier soap operas, with a slightly ghoulish fascination for dinge and sleaze, of which the Pagford residents abound; A Casual Vacancy became a guilty pleasure.Rowling clearly draws on her experiences as a social worker to produce her characters, some of which are unnervingly vivid; Simon, for example, the mechanics of whose control over his family through fear and violence were especially well rendered. On the other hand I found Bridie, a resident of the Fields social housing estate, to be a grotesque caricature, one-dimensional and unconvincing. As a single parent, an addict and a prostitute she might have provoked a great deal of sympathy had these aspects been under-girded by an attempt at a complex, humanising psychology. But Bridie was debased by the writer, weighed down by a Neanderthal ignorance, an utter dearth of mothering instinct and no vestige of self-respect or even self-justification. Appalling personal hygiene heaped humiliation on to insult. She was, sadly, a brutish figure rather than a tragic one.Interestingly it was the teenage characters which engaged me the most. Fats is a monster but given his parenting I could completely believe why. Krystal is like a cheap chocolate truffle; hard on the outside, soft on the inside but too tainted by the additives of her circumstances to be palatable. Arf appealed to me most of all, the only character I found genuinely sympathetic. I couldn't help but speculate whether the teenagers' furtive sexual couplings and voracious consumption of internet porn hadn't formed some flip-side back-story for Harry, Ron and Hermione in the author's mind! Rowling clearly knows and understands the young person's psyche. I wonder if that isn't what she should stick with, in future.In the end the characters' relentless unpleasantness and unremitting angst did begin to feel oppressive. Oh! For someone to do something kind! For someone - anyone - to be happy! But it seemed that, in Pagford, it was too much to ask. The only kind, happy character, Barry Fairbrother, meets his demise in chapter one. His absence, both in the book and on the town council, is the vortex around which events and the hapless Pagford residents revolve. As such, I expected the election, to which the characters' political manoeuvrings all move, to be a dramatic climax, both an eruption and a resolution of the myriad issues. In fact it was something of a damp squib. The dramatic denouement comes from another, much more unexpected source.Rowling's dialogue proliferates with the F word, which some readers might find offensive. I found it pointless and rather juvenile. If it was an attempt to be `grown up' it failed. Her prose, on the other hand, is sharp and crisp, sometimes acerbic. Her gimlet eye for people's flaws is pitiless.As character-led fiction, with a lovely unity of setting, A Casual Vacancy works well . If that's what you like (and I do), you'll enjoy it. You'll also enjoy this:Lost Boys",4,"05 1, 2013",1367366400,"[0, 0]"

The book deals with a reality that we try to facade with the perfect home, fancy clothes and the perception of having it all together in public.  Yet, as this book does, it takes you behind closed doors of many characters to show you the issues of the characters and how those issues flow into the lives of the people  around you whether you choose to interact with them or not.

Instead, let me summarize my reaction to this book and perhaps it will help others make up their own mind whether to read it or not.I bought this book because I am a fan of Harry Potter and think J.K. Rowling is an excellent writer.  I wanted to see what an adult book of her's would be like and I was not disappointed.  However, you need to put all thoughts of HP out of your head and it helps to forget Rowling is the author to avoid unfavorable comparisons.It would have been easy to stop reading after about 50 pages, as it is not the type of book I normally enjoy.  The little town of Pagford is filled with petty, gossipy, selfish characters who, initially, really got on my nerves, but after a while I got sucked into their stories.  No one is completely evil and no one will be nominated for sainthood either, but the dynamics between the affluent village of Pagford and their neighbors, the struggling town of Yarvil, made me care, and by the end of the novel I cared a lot.  I haven't read other reviews mentioning it, so perhaps it's only me, but that last paragraph really squeezed my heart.""The Casual Vacancy"" is well written and the social commentary will make you think.  It is not always an easy read.  Lighthearted, wry observation is equally offset by tragedy and loss.  Her teenage characters are particularly well written, while a few of the adults, such as Howard and Shirley, seem a bit over the top.  However, all the characters are written in a certain way to emphasize one point or another, so this is not a criticism.  The balance of the book, for me, was just right, and it's one of those stories I won't soon forget.Harry Potter?  No, far from it.  An excellent novel?  Yes.  For a book that I probably would not have read based on plot description alone, I was surprised by how deeply it affected my emotions.  It's not a book for everybody, and it's a different side of Rowling altogether, but I am extremely glad I gave it a chance.  In my opinion, definitely a worthwhile read.

His death leaves an open position on the town's council. As different people vie for the position, long held secrets are brought to light and the peaceful town of Pagford isn't nearly as peaceful as it seems.I am fully aware that this is not Harry Potter. I understand that this book is targeted at adults. If Rowling's intention was to write something completely different than Harry Potter, then she accomplished that goal. Knowing to expect something totally different than Harry Potter, I was still shocked at the extreme direction this book took. I've read books by other authors who have written a popular children's/young adult series and then wrote an adult book. In those books, I was still able to get a feel for the author's voice. Not so with Casual Vacancy. It really felt like it was someone completely different writing the book. Language was terrible. I've read adult books with language in them in the past, and I typically ignore it. In this case, it was almost every other sentence (and in some cases words) that was a curse word. I felt like I needed a list of characters to keep them all straight. There wasn't one particular character that I was attached to. Authority is completely disrespected. There is abundant drug use, sex, hints of abuse and neglect, suicidal tendencies in addition to the coarse language. There were some chapters that after reading, I wanted to go take a shower because I felt dirty. Will I still read books that Rowling writes? Most likely as I love Harry Potter.My personal opinion is that Rowling needs to continue to write children's/young adult books and not to attempt a book that doesn't even sound like she wrote it!I rented this book from the library.

Now that we got that out of the way, The Casual Vacancy, Rowling&#8217;s first venture into the world of adult literary fiction, showcases the writer&#8217;s talent in a very different way. As always, whether you like the book or not will depend on your literary tastes.The story begins with the death of a prominent member of a small English town,; but this event is merely the catalyst that enables Rowling to introduce the reader to the various miserable characters of Pagford Parish. The news of Barry Fairbrother&#8217;s demise spreads in the usual way of tiny towns with nothing better to do: gossip. The reader travels along the gossip chain, meeting new and interesting characters along the way. This part of the story was pretty amusing for me because I felt like I had known a few of these characters.However, while I found some parts of the novel interesting and entertaining, I didn&#8217;t exactly like the book as a whole. I felt as if it was Rowling&#8217;s experiment in character development, a practice of sorts. The pacing was painfully slow and I could never really put my finger on the actual plot of the story, only that it was about how one death (or life) affects an entire community in the smallest of ways. While that is a beautiful sentiment, I believe that it would&#8217;ve been better kept to a short story or novelette, rather than a 500 page novel.This book is not for everyone. If you like a book that has a fast pace, a clear plot, and an exciting climax, move on. For those of you who are voyeuristic or like a good soap opera, you may find this enjoyable.

There are many kids' fantasy series that will never outsell the Bible-- it is JK Rowling's genius that set HP apart. Many of the people who wrote bad reviews of this book seem to be mostly disappointed that this book is not another Harry Potter. So please, do not read, or review, this book from the mistaken notion that it should somehow mirror Harry Potter. It is a book for adults, which implies not just chronological age but also an assumption of maturity. Again, because so many people have made this mistake: this book is written by the author of Harry Potter, but it is not Harry Potter, so get over it.JK Rowling has an amazing mastery of language and of human nature, and she has the amazing ability to find humor in the most grim situations. Yes, many of the characters are despicable and flawed, but I feel like I know everyone of these characters in their flesh and blood forms. I think I can re-read this book many times because it is so layered and rich, and her writing is so flawless and nuanced. And it is funny!!! It is a sign of the author's brilliance that she can handle many truly depressing topics, and still be laugh out loud funny. An example is the image of a goat passing through a snake's GI tract as metaphor for Krystal's passage through the school system.I read a review that said the reader disagreed with JK Rowling (!!!!), that the reader did not think this book is funny!!?!? Whoever that reader is, needs to stick to Nicholas Sparks novels and leave the heavy reading to the grownups.Anyway, I think if you love extremely good writing, you will love this book.

There was insufficient character development to really know any of them so they became one-dimensional characatures of various forms of evil.The local accents also made it difficult to understand the dialogue at times.  I had to reread several of these to know what the characters were saying.The main purpose of my finishing the book was to try to figure out where it was leading.

Rowling has ""set to"" with her obvious dislike of the parochial, small-minded English middle class, and its lack of any decent sentiment for those less fortunate than themselves - and that's no small number of the population today.Clearly wanting to create some distance from her famous reputation as a children's storyteller, this couldn't be further from the magic of Hogwarts, albeit that it's at least a little reminiscent of Rowling's desire to showcase difference and convey a message of tolerance. JK's not in the business of creating just a good story; she's trying to make a difference in the world too.Not the easiest of reads, owing largely to the unpleasant characters, but persevere because you'll be hooked into the plot soon enough.  Predictable to the extent that it was clearly not going to end well, but precisely how was anyone's guess.Congratulations on an amazing transition to adult fiction.

"0316228532","ACAVINTHJABFY","Amazon Customer","Casual Vacancy Hits Adult Market Bullseye","Yes, I know this book isn't for kids; it's J.K. Rowling's first attempt at writing a novel for adults. But as a died-in-the-wool fan of the Hogwarts clan - I've devoured every single page of every single Harry Potter book, seen all the movies and bought all the DVDs - I figured if she can work her magic that superbly on books that appeal to just about all ages, her new one is bound to be pretty good at the very worst.To be sure, reviews have been mixed; some folks think it's great, and others have given it so-so ratings. So from the git-go, I tried to keep an open mind and, of course, put wizards and Muggles out of my thoughts. That said, after just a few chapters, Rowling's writing style came through. Maybe it was my unconscious mind peeking through, but I could tell who wrote this book right from page one.The setting is set in the small English town of Pagford and opens with the unexpected death of one of the town's council members (thus creating the title for the book). From there, it explores the backgrounds of the town and its rival neighboring village of Yarvil and a number of the residents of both - warts and all. All this is tied to the search for a council replacement; the winner, it seems, will have the power to effect changes that will be welcomed by some and not others.Early on, it's a big of a chore to keep all the characters straight. Rowling does a terrific job of introducing them and providing background information, but perhaps because my aging brain doesn't have the recall ability of my younger years, I tended to be a little foggy on who's who in a until about a third of the way through, when new characters stopped coming and I was comfortable in knowing the good, the bad, and in some cases, the ugly, of each.Yes, it takes a bit of slogging to get through the book - at 512 pages, it's hardly a piece of fluff (but if you think this is long, try wading through the 739-page Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book in her HP series). But just as with the Potter books, it is character development, and using well-crafted words and phrases to show how they're all intertwined, that is Rowling's strong suit here. Described by some as a comedy, this book is not a cliff-hanger that will have you on the edge of your seat; there are no ax murders or kidnappings and nobody falls off a broom during a Quidditch match.  Rather, it's an in-depth look at life that touches the emotions on many levels. Worth reading? Absolutely!",4,"12 30, 2012",1356825600,"[2, 3]"

In even the worst characters, she gave me insight into why they are the way they are.  I didn't think she excused anyone's behavior in the book, but at least gave some understanding of what led to the behavior.  I found the ending incredibly moving and emotional, just a powerful book.  And the story was very relevant.  Not an American book, not set in America, but after this past election I thought the exploration of rich and poor and how the rich views and treats the poor was handled very well.

In HP, I genuinely cared about the characters.  I felt for them -- I felt connected or impacted in some way by each of them.  Even as an almost irrelevant character, I felt compassion and sadness for the father of Cedric Diggory when he was murdered.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about A Casual Vacancy.This book details the mundane lives of several families - the Mollisons, the Walls, the Weedons, the Jawandas, the Prices, the Bawdens, and the Fairbrothers - none of whom have any real depth, except perhaps the Weedons.The problem with this book is, Rowling didn't make me care about the characters.  I felt nothing for them, to the point that I actually started hoping she was going to kill them off one by one so I didn't have to read about them anymore.  The plot (if you can call it that) was extremely weak:The story begins with the death of Parish Councilman Barry Fairbrother and the entire story is about who is going to take his seat on the council.  The thing is: who cares?  Without giving anything away, should you still attempt to get through this tragedy of literature, I didn't care that the council seat of this 50-person town was empty.  I didn't care that some people wanted to include the ""Fields"" (essentially the ghetto of the town) into another town and some didn't.  Rowling just didn't make me understand why it mattered.Further, I was finally forced to admit something to myself that I have been avoiding for years:  at a literary level, Rowling is just not a good writer.  Her sentences are short, meaningless, and lack depth and perceptive.  I happily ignored this in HP because they are, after all, young adult books, but now that she is writing for us grown ups, her writing style needs to reflect that, and sadly, it didn't.A Casual Vacancy just did not live up to my expectations, which admittedly, may have been too high.

You can decide for yourself whether it is an astounding step forward in her writing career or simply an astounding step.  For the price you will pay for this book, be sure you are going to enjoy it and there is doubt on that topic.The tenor of many reviews of this work is that it is unrelentingly grim and without hope.  Rowling employs lots of four letter words and four letter verbs to prove she is writing for the adult reader, but the most important four letter word requisite in reading dour and dark works is missing (hope).  In the sample chapters there isn't ONE redeemable character.  I personally suspect Rowling spent a bit too much time in the past five years immersed in works like ""Girl with the Dragon Tatoo"" and has therefore spewed forth a novel that runs along the same ""humanity is violent, especially the men and we are all s--t"" lines.So take advantage of one of Kindle's strongest features to download a sample and read it.

I pushed through to the bitter end, but the end was even worse for wear than the bulk of the volume, leading to a feeling of dissolution, despair, and failure.  So if that is the goal of the celebrated author in this foray into adult drama, then this is a success.

Rowling does a thoughtful job of examining a small groups of people and the enmeshments that snarl their lives.  The events following the death of a counsel man, and the efforts of these people to deal with his absence, set the novel a task of explicating how these people come together.  I think a good job was done in exploring the difference between the public persona and the actual thought and circumstances of each character,  I especially like Krystal, the bad girl, whose genuine love for her brother goes largely unknown, as she becomes vilified as both ""a duty and a pleasure"" except by those who came to know her.  The implausible elements of some of the ending are the the only setbacks to five stars.  This novel stands up to the hype, and I wasn't disappointed.",4,"10 3, 2012",1349222400,"[7, 13]"

There is way too much time spent on developing characters that, honestly, didn't need to really be developed. I found it laborious to read about the towns, and found myself wanting to finish the book just so it would be done. I can respect the detail that she put into the lives of the kids, and thought it was bold of Rowling to touch on such hard issues (especially with her fame being made on children's books), however, I don't feel that the book was as brazen as it should have (or could have) been.

"0316228532","AZEJGBO0B4N5P","Amie McCracken ""Devourer of Books""","Amazing in its own right","It took me a while to get to The Casual Vacancy by J.K. Rowling. I was so worried. I had seen so many reviews that didn't particularly shine a very good light. But then I decided to just dive in. I like literary fiction, and I was dying to see if Rowling could prove herself. I had always said, seven books is cool, but she would really prove herself as a writer when she wrote something outside of the Harry Potter world. (At least to me.) So here was the proof. And man did she do well.So many intriguing twists and turns that made me smile and get giddy. I really liked it the further I read, even though it was a really long book. It probably could have done with some more editing cuts. But Rowling really knows how to write teenagers. The teens in this book were very deep, diverse, and strong. It may have been an adult book, but she should keep teens in all of her work.The use of parentheses was a little overboard. There were some times I would be reading and suddenly I would see a closing parenthesis and think, what is that doing there? I'd look back and see that she had inserted an entire page and a half parenthetical. There is also the issue of switching narrators from paragraph to paragraph. I actually found it very smooth since most of the transitions went from one person thinking about another to the other person then narrating, or something of that sort to show a change in narrator. I rarely had to go back to understand who was talking.I think this book caught such a hard wrap because Rowling's normal audience couldn't wait to devour more of her work. And this is exactly why publishers say not to switch genres as an author. For literary fiction fans, this book is definitely a hard hitter. For young adult fans, it is a complete dud. So take it as you will.My biggest advice on this one: pretend it's not by J.K. Rowling. Don't think Harry Potter will come out and save Pagford from Voldemort in the end. This is not Harry Potter. This is something so different and yet completely stunning in its own right.",4,"01 17, 2013",1358380800,"[0, 0]"

Except for the reaction to the death of the council member, there doesn't seem to be a plot, and frankly, I wouldn't care what happens to any of these people if there were.

As a die-hard Harry Potter fan, I was eager to see what she had brought to the table. I knew it was going to be an adult novel, but I was assuming this simply meant an older cast and no magic. I was wrong on this count. It is very much an adult novel, and that's partially why I gave the book 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5. Not because of the adult content (I'm 20 years and can thus handle it), but it seems like in the first few chapters she is trying to shove its adultness into your face. Also, the beginning of the book is slow in a few regards as you get to know the wide cast of characters and the history of the central problem of the novel. However, once you bypass these facts, JKR once again proves her extreme talent in providing incredibly detailed and in-depth characters. She makes you take second glances at people whom you would probably despise in real life and second guess your own treatment of such people.However, there are two other negatives I'd like to point out. The book deals with tough subjects in a very real way, but she deals with so many tied so neatly within in her cast of characters that it's not quite believable. Secondly, the fact that there is almost NOTHING that is positive about the book. Granted I don't expect every book to end in a meadow of daisies where every lives happily ever after, but almost everything is left off in an incredibly depressing fashion with no upside.All of that said, I very much enjoyed the book once JKR settled into her natural writing and found the topics refreshingly honest, even if it could have been toned down overall. This is NOT a book to turn to for positive messages or for the hope of a happy ending, but the characters, while not usually the most likable, are all compelling in their own ways a create a fascinating and tragic dynamic. 4 out of 5 and recommended if you can handle it. DO NOT read it simply if you are a fan of HP. With the exception of her well-written characters, to even remotely compare the series with this novel is almost laughable. Both are brilliant in entirely different ways and should be treated as such.",4,"10 28, 2012",1351382400,"[1, 2]"

After a decade of whimsical, yet dark Harry Potter books, nobody expected this slow-building, cynical look at class warfare and self-centered suburban drama.The Casual Vacancy had a slow start and a lot of characters to keep track of (it was likely a big mistake naming in-laws Shirley and Samantha so that readers could confuse them for 500 pages) but it was a beautiful piece of literature. I think that the main reason for the starkly negative reviews, is that Rowling forces many a reader to see something detestable in themselves. She allows the reader to build up opinions of her flawed characters before revealing pasts and virtues to make the reader feel as judgmental as the loathsome Mollison family. Rowling shows clear political leanings that may have alienated socially conservative readers. I have to say, though, if you know anything of Rowling's biography as a single mother who escaped an abusive marriage and cared for her daughter with government assistance before writing Harry Potter, becoming richer than the Queen, and donating millions of her personal fortune to charity, you should not be surprised.This book is heartbreaking, darkly funny, and worth giving a chance to get started.

She absolutely did.This one was one of those books that I couldn&#8217;t just read straight through. I needed breaks. Quite a few. It&#8217;s not a flaw in the book, it&#8217;s that some of it was so real it was deadly depressing & I needed some time out. The Weedon family was almost too sad to abide with but were too important to simply skim. Throughout I was sure that things were not going to end well. The Price family seconded them in the sad line. The other families, though having high levels of unhappiness, were more easily read through. The residents of Pagford & the Fields were real in all the great and terrible ways. And accessible in that any of us could easily be or know any of them. This doesn&#8217;t make for a breezy read but it did make for a compelling one.Personally, I found Sukhvinder to be the heart of the story for me & from her introduction, I was most interested in her & held hope that her plight would improve. I finished the book feeling very pleased about her. I think she may have been my favorite character & I did not even expect her to have as pivotal a role as she wound up having.

"0316228532","A2SDSO720DXPFO","Ann","A lot of realistic issues crammed into a volatile political landscape","I know why you've either read, or are going to read this book. It's because you're curious. Curious as to what has Rowling come up with for adults post Potter, and if it can live up to the legend of Potter or not. I went into this with my mind still set in the idyllic childish world of Harry Potter (you really shouldn't, clear your mind and just read this book as it is) and I can tell you the exact moment that Rowling effectively shattered any childhood fantasies that I had left (it was when she dropped about 7 f-bombs in the span of two consecutive pages really early on).Back when I was a kid we only had three channels, one was french, one was usually news and one always seemingly played the long running (and still going) British soap opera Coronation Street. That's what The Casual Vacancy reminds me exactly of, a bunch of old ladies that live for gossip, teenagers being teenagers and just life as you would expect in a small town with some deep secrets.The premise is that Barry Fairbrother dies suddenly, and he leaves his seat open on the Parish Council of Pagford that needs to be filled (a casual vacancy if you will). But in this little town there's a bigger and more volatile problem that has divided the council long before Barry's death. The Fields - basically Pagford's version of a slum, where there's dilapidated low income housing filled with druggies, prostitutes and other unsavory characters. Soon it becomes a heated race between sides to fill the seat to either evict or save Fields.Unfortunately, The Casual Vacancy is painfully slow. There's so many characters (I don't think I'll cover them all because it'd swallow up this whole post) that it takes forever to set each one up in their dull lives and the role they have in the community. Rowling takes an approach where she takes several story lines and weaves them so that will catastrophically crash together. She adds a 'shock' factor to each character to try and make them memorable, but I still had issues telling them apart or remembering them or really connecting with them - I felt like I was an observer to the story instead of really being drawn into it. It took me much longer to get through this book because I got bored and had to put it book down for a time before I'd find the will to keep reading again - but by then I'd forgotten who was who. So your best bet is to probably take notes, or read it in continuously.Since Rowling started out writing for kids, there's a certain level of innocence that she had to maintain in the Potter books. But here - WOW does she ever let loose. Her characters hit everything from extremely conservative god fearing racist homophobic upper middle class folk, to stringent foreign parents, drug abusing prostitutes, rapists, child molestation, domestic violence, incest, bullying, self harm, affairs and teenagers experimenting with everything from drugs (I wasn't all that surprised with Rowling's extensive knowledge of marijuana, heh.), voyeur sex, masturbation and pornography. She even manages to sneak in some health problems like obesity, diabetes and stroke. However, things get really dark at some points, I had to sit back and actually remind myself that this was the same woman that wrote Harry Potter - I think if I ever go back and read those again it'll definitely be in a different light.I have to admit I got really uncomfortable at certain parts, like when characters were calling others racial slurs, or being incredibly homophobic, or being exceptionally cruel to someone. Rowling does an excellent job getting you to think about all these things, and that they are a reality - but in the end it seems that nothing fully got resolved. There wasn't much retribution to be had against these high and mighty characters, and the lowly just seemed to sink a bit lower. Maybe that's what she wants you to think about - how crappy life can be and how it goes on, but it's not what I wanted in my fictional reads. I wanted some good feelings at the end, and I definitely didn't feel very satisfied - there were too many ""but what happens to these people after??"" kind of moments.There's a lot of British slang and jokes that took some re-reads before I actually got it. So that did slow down my enjoyment and speed at which I read. To show the class division, Rowling even uses a cockney accent - which was amusing at first, but I quickly grew tired of trying to decipher it (I'm TERRIBLE with accents, even written ones apparently). I can't say that the plot was completely predictable, I didn't really try to. I spent most of my time just watching and observing the intense secrets and drama unfold - which was really quite good. Ironically, all the adults seemed to be shallow and condescending, and once again it's her teenage characters that stole the show with creativity, pain, angst and the dire situations that their parents have put them in.It was too slow for my liking, with too many characters to keep track of. Rowling may have packed too much drama into this by addressing so many intense issues altogether, but the way it ended may just end up fueling the destructive fires in other communities that are facing these same problems. There are some redeeming qualities, but I just overall didn't enjoy it that much. If you really need to satisfy your curiosity about this one, definitely borrow it.",2,"10 20, 2012",1350691200,"[0, 3]"
"0316228532","A2YBA4I4TY9XFS","Annie","Nothing like before","In a way, The Casual Vacancy, by J.K. Rowling, is the story of a dysfunctional family. It follows the lives of 7 families who live in the community of Pagford, a small English city outside of the booming metropolis of Yarvil. Over 6 parts, we discover each member of these families and how they interact with each other, and other families within the community.All the characters presented have unfortunate parts of their personalities which make them unlikeable and only a few of them are shown to have any redeeming qualities.Overall, this is a great story. It's a story of reflection and how you perceive yourself. I was disappointed by the end. There didn't seem to be much of a resolution. A lot was left unresolved that I think could have been handled in a couple of chapters tacked onto the end. I felt as if I only got a partial story and was missing the end of the book.

Once that was sorted out, the plot moves along and definitely engages the reader, at least this reader.  If you're bothered by casual profanity and strong adult themes-- and I do mean strong, domestic violence, hard drug use, rape, brutal bullying, to name a few-- this is not your book.  All the characters are flawed, some more than others, most are not very nice and some are outright vicious.  Once I got into the book, I really could not put it down, and the complex plot resolved itself satisfactorily although certainly not happily.  It can only be unimaginably difficult for a writer to work with a monkey on her back as enormous as the monumental success of the Harry Potter books; Rowling long ago showed herself to be brilliant at creating deeply unsympathetic characters.

Therefore, I was anxious to read her first book written specifically for adults.  Also, I am a great fan of those who write of life in small English villages.  But be forewarned:  this is not the quaint and cozy village as found in works by Rosamunde Pilcher or Maeve Binchy.  This is a dark and seamy tale that explores the worst of rural life, the not-so-neighborly residents who wouldn't lend a hand if their life depended on it.That being said, this was enjoyable enough.  There were many well-defined characters and the story moved along well because the author is very good at her craft.  She knows how to tell a story, although I wish she could have done it with the omission of the profanity which was so heavily used it was distracting.  Also repugnant was the way the adults, two characters in particular,  treated their children.  With parents like those in the village of Pagford, there is very little hope for the next generation.The story centers on the death of the man everybody liked, Barry Fairbrother.  When he dies in the opening pages, the rest of the village is left to carry on recalling his virtues, remembering his failings.  There are numerous characters, and the sheer number of them is overwhelming at first.  However, as the story moves along each does become well-defined in his or her own right, and by mid-novel the reader has a good picture of this village which will never make England's list of top ten places tourists should visit.  Neighbors hate neighbors, children hate parents, spouses hate each other----it's a veritable hell on earth.  Bookended by tragic deaths, the author explores those who think they are at the top of the social ladder and those who have no hope of pulling themselves out of the quagmire they were born into.",3,"10 12, 2012",1350000000,"[3, 3]"

Post-World War II, it has notes of John Mortimer's Paradise Postponed and more than a few hints of Martin Amis. Rowling sets her nominally political tale about a local concil election in a setting that contains both the beauty of a traditional English village - Pagford - and the grit of an industrial city - Yarvil - inextricably linked, as the history of England includes the green and pleasant lands and the dark Satanic mills. She people both towns and tells the interwoven tales of many families, contrasting the middle class and the poor. What is unique about this book are the combined voices of the teenagers who inhabit it: Krystal, Andrew, Sukhvinder, Fats, and Gaia. These are young people struggling to survive and find a way to successful adulthood - some will make it and some won't. While Rowling can be somewhat humorous in portraying the imperfect adults in this novel, she is serious about the children and depicts them with knowledge, empathy. The most poignant character is the most desperate, Krystal Weedon, who came to remind me in many ways of Bill Sykes' Nancy. She is a true English heroine for modern times. The conversations of flawed parents and their desperate children are gripping and memorable. I cried at the end of this book and I'm not sure at all why reviewers are calling it a black comedy.  The images of Krystal and her young brother Robbie at the end of the book will stay with you for a long time. HIghly recommended.",5,"09 29, 2012",1348876800,"[18, 27]"
"0316228532","A2L1LEXETSZCE5","arak86","A Tragically Honest Portrait of the Human Condition","J.K. Rowling wrote a novel for adults. She wrote a political statement. Most of all, she wrote a novel about humanity. Written from a third person omniscient point of view, Rowling granted the readers glimpses into the innermost thoughts and emotions of over fifteen different citizens of the small town of Pagford. The result presented itself as a tragically honest portrait of the human condition.Admittedly, in the echo of most of the Harry Potter books, The Casual Vacancy began slowly. At first, I thought Rowling might prove to disappoint as an adult novelist. However, I quickly retracted my position as her novel sucked me into Pagfordian life.The reality in the small British town forced the reader to confront both sides of political issues facing voters worldwide while demonstrating how politics affected people individually. In this way, Rowling brought home the trickle-down effects of government policies, from the general, necessary budget cuts to the affected shattered family.Rowling imprinted a story on my brain, a mark I will continue to relive until she deigns us with another classic.",5,"12 1, 2012",1354320000,"[2, 2]"

And she again proves she can write with ""The Casual Vacancy"".There are, however, two overriding issues that I have with the book and that stopped me from thoroughly enjoying it.  One is that there is an overabundance and unnecessary use of four-letter words.  It's as if Rowling was trying to prove that this is an ADULT book (make no mistake) so she made sure to throw in as many words as possible, even when not really called for in the context of the story.  I'm no prude when it comes to four-letter words, but this one is way over the top.  I get it-this book is for adults.  She doesn't have to prove it on every page.The second issue is that while there is a huge cast of characters, not one of them seems to have any redeeming values.  They are all nasty, petty and unlikeable.  One of my pet peeves is when an author gives the reader not one person to root for or admire.  Does it make the reading juicier?  Maybe, but it also makes the reading wearying and not a lot of fun.  Why would I care what happens to any of them when I can't stand them?Judging by the pretty even number of people who gave this book 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 stars, it's clear that what some people like about the book, others dislike.  Does that make it successful?  I'm not sure.  I don't think Rowling needs to always stick with Harry Potter, but I'd like a little of the ambiguity and joy that she gave to her HP characters and the fun I had while reading it.",2,"12 25, 2012",1356393600,"[0, 1]"

Rowling repeated herself over and over while trying to fill-in the characters' personalities without varying the message or delivery.

In the throes of Potter passion, I was always so impressed with how big her scope can be as a writer, how imaginative. This book is the polar opposite of scope, taking cues from the Jane Austen school of thought that all you need for a good story is a few families in a small town and a spark. Unfortunately, the citizens of Pagford are never as interesting or sympathy-inducing as Austen's characters. Mostly, they are ordinary small town people who peck and gossip, desperately trying to hide their own flaws and secrets while exposing those of their neighbors. Some of them are better eggs than others, but they all make a rather run-of-the-mill omelet in the end.My biggest complaint about this book is the pacing. It really doesn't get going until the last ten chapters or so. Up until then, its mind numbingly slow. My second biggest complaint is that I just don't see the point of it all. Rowling has given us a very ordinary story about very ordinary people. They all experience some form of suffering, some of them change, some of them don't. I think it could have been an interesting narrative...it just wasn't.SPOILER ALERTRowling is a terrific writer, there's no doubt about it. It's very hard to find fault with her prose and she handled the different points of view of her many characters with aplomb. I also thought it was interesting that the book begins with a funeral that results in a divided community and ends with a funeral that VERY tenuously pieces it back together. Perhaps one of the more effective themes in the book is the ways in which children pay for their parents' choices and personalities, and how they then filter their own experiences back out in to the world. By far, the most intriguing character to me is Krystal Wheedon, the girl around whom so much chaos and conflict arises. While her suicide was both plausible and dramatically useful, it did seem to deflate what little momentum the book gained towards the end. The idea that perhaps she will find a way out of her hellish circumstances and go on to a (slightly) better life was the only thing keeping me hooked.

Currently the populace of The Fields is made up of low income, government dependent residence so many in Pagford would like to see them sent to Yarvil, Barry Fairweather is a popular resident of Pagford and he came from The Fields and he has made many good argument about why the people of Pagford need to take care of the people of The Fields.  The death of Barry Fairweather heralds a change in the weather for the anti-Fields clan and they are eager to fill his seat with a candidate sympathetic to their cause.Initially, I had a problem with keeping all the characters straight and which side of the issue they fell.  Then, I realized it didn't really matter.  The book wasn't really about that.  The book was about all these people struggling to survive in this little town.  There was the married Indian doctor in love with another man and her bullied daughter.  The desperate housewife that finds sexual gratification in much younger men.  There are also the children of the town who do some really crazy things to escape the pressures of their parents.  Plus, all the other characters floundering in the wake of Barry Fairweather's death.I was somewhat disappointed in this book.  I don't know what I was really expecting, but this wasn't really it.  There were a few times when I felt like putting it down in favor of something more exciting, but I knew if I did I probably wouldn't pick it up again.  So I stuck it out and the ending did make up for the less than thrilling beginning and middle.  I know a lot of us were secretly hoping for a few flashes of the Harry Potter world and there are definitely NONE of those.  This was a very realistic book and it was dark and depressing...it was sad.  I can't take anything away from JK Rowling's writing talent though.

In Casual Vacancy the author gives us a cast of deeply selfish characters who between them exhibit pretty much every vice in varying degrees and commit acts of cruelty and depravity both great and small. What we are not given is any sense of hope. At the end there are hints of repentance and reform, but the book has taught us not to trust such things. Even apparent acts of charity are portrayed as being motivated by selfish reasons. The town of Pagford is a town peopled by grotesque caricatures, where no one can be trusted and compassion is a chimera.Whilst not badly written, I found the book slow to get into and, frankly, depressing to read. My only criticism of the writer's style is the constant use of brackets, which jarred on me every time and broke the flow of the prose. At the same time, the tendency to present stereotypes rather than balanced, realistic characters made it difficult to care that much about anybody. There was very little story to be told and this was no morality tale; for the people of Pagford there could be no redemption.

The Casual Vacancy is captivating in every aspect and is sure to be set on my bookshelf of favourites for years to come. Each character has a deep backstory with realistic motivations behind their actions. You might not like everyone, but that is the whole point of the story. It is reality. Pagford isn't full of witty characters who have exhilarating adventures; it is a representation of real life, with its foul language and dubious intentions and each character has their own responsibilities to face or avoid.It is undeniably a book for grown-ups, but that being said; at no point is the language or behaviour of any of the characters jarring. With each chapter that passes you learn more about the characters, understanding the motives behind their sour personality or troublesome behaviour. Rowling covers a wide variety of difficult issues, such as self-harm, drug addiction and rape, and while it is a very dark novel, somehow it is simultaneously uplifting. Everything that happens is part of the world that we know, and dealt with in a manner that helps you to accept those parts, alongside all the good in the world. Aside from anything else, I'd recommend this book for the benefits it will surely have on your vocabulary alone, as Rowling has a true talent for using every word under the sun in an interesting and insightful manner.Reviewed by Elizabeth Wright on behalf of BestChickLit.com",5,"10 5, 2012",1349395200,"[4, 11]"

When Barry Fairbrother dies suddenly, he leaves a vacant seat on the town council. In the election that ensues, secrets are unearthed, lives are ruined, and people are snide to each other for 500 pages.It's difficult to engage with this book because the characters are just so unlikable.

"0316228532","AV74NYPSKHXBU","Black Plum","Surprisingly Not So Bad","I must say that I really didn't expect much from J.K. Rowling's first adult novel. The plot sounded boring, and the first few chapters were extremely off-putting. But it actually wasn't half bad, though certainly not as good as Harry Potter. When the aforementioned Barry Fairbrother dies, the seemingly idyllic town of Pagford is thrown into turmoil. There's tons of controversy over this district called ""the Fields"", full of drug addicts, which many think shouldn't be part of Pagford. Though it seems like a typical English village, Pagford is home  to some pretty nasty people. On the surface, the plot seems unremarkable, but really, the novel was interesting, though also slow, in parts.The annoying thing was that you practically couldn't read two pages without coming across either a lewd reference or a curse word (and by curse word, I mean the f-word or the like). And really, I think that though some of it was necessary, a lot could have been taken out, and a lot better novel could have been crafted.However, The Casual Vacancy was - if not suspenseful- then certainly something that kept you reading, once you got into it. All of the characters were interesting, and the good part about it was that there were chapters narrated from the point of view of many of the characters. So, for example, ""Fats"", one of the teenage boys, is bullying this other girl, so you think he's evil. But obviously, he's not totally evil. He's just a person, like everyone else, who does some bad things, just like everyone else, and who has a good side, just like everyone else.The writing wasn't nearly as good as in Harry Potter, but on its own wasn't bad. I really was kind of surprised that I liked it. I started the first few chapters perhaps a month before reading the whole thing, and immediately gave up The Casual Vacancy as a dud. But perhaps I shouldn't have been so hasty. There were some parts that made me squirm, and it certainly is an ADULT novel. Die-hard fans of Harry Potter will probably be disappointed.

No I was not expecting Harry Potter but as described I was expecting a funny and enjoyable book. What I got instead was a plodding read on subjects that one would hardly call comedic.The book starts off bad. The first 1/4 of the book is a hodge podge of characters thrown together in a form that makes it extremely difficult to keep track of. You're 10 pages on one character and then 15 on another and so on with nothing connecting them making it difficult when they pop up another 50-60 pages later to remember who this was previously. It's just bad writing which makes the whole book more difficult to enjoy. Things do improve about 1/3 of the way through as she begins to mix the characters together but still it's a long slog to get there.In terms of the characters themselves none of them are people you can identify with or even like. Drug users, spousal abusers and teenagers being nasty to each other generally describes the character list. It's really hard to care about any of them... no, make that impossible because they're all just nasty people doing cruel things to each other. Most of the people in the book get simple joy from being cruel to others and that generally seems to be their motivations through the whole thing. The remaining few characters serve simply to be the victims and generally are so weak and pathetic you can't even feel sorry for them.The book itself is described as a dark comedy. Dark is an accurate description but a comedy? This book is about as funny as a tooth ache. If you find nasty people being cruel to each other funny then perhaps you'll find the book humorous but I didn't.I liked Rowling's Harry Potter books and the sense of humor she showed in them so when I heard about this book I was expecting something witty and entertaining which is basically how this book was publicized to be but it's neither. Joan Rowling is a talented writer as she has proven in the past, so to have her come out with something this poor is a major disappointment.

It is distressing that readers punish the author for the greed of the publishers. I had no idea what to expect and for some reason I was thinking Agatha Christie or PD James. Truth is, it was more like Salinger or Vonnegut, harsh realism and depressing insight into human weaknesses. The book is gritty, dark, humorous, and too believable. The characters are real, fragile, not likeable, and for the most part doomed. Rowling's writing is seamless and drags you in. Just like Harry Potter, you feel as if you know these people. You wish you could shake them, kill them, or help them. I couldn't put the book down. I can't say I enjoyed it, rather I experienced it and I am sure I will be thinking about it for a long time to come.

Barry means different things to different people, but sufficient to say that he leaves a gap in the lives of those who knew him. There's no avoiding the cliche of 'ripples over the surface of a pond' as his friends and acquaintances manoeuvre to fill the void - the most significant of which is his now 'vacant' (the casual vacancy of the title)parish council seat.Reading this book has put me through a range of emotions, the most enduring of which are depression and despair.Let me start by saying that I hated the book initially - I thought the writing style was -well - childish, and I wasn't sure where the story was going. The more I became familiar with the multi-character point of view, the more the tide of events (I won't say plot, because this is more of a stream of consciousness novel) made sense.Some of the sentence construction and descriptions are simplistic but the subject matter is definitely not. And this is what raises the book from a 2 star, to a 3.5 star book. The characters are well-developed and gritty (doesn't mean I like them, or would want to read about them again.) The mental disintegration of Parminder is frightening realistic, and the disgusting self-congratulatory Howard Mollinson made my flesh crawl.However well crafted, I did not enjoy this book - it is too gritty, bleak and depressing - I can't help feeling that JK ought to have written under a pen name in order to let the novel find its target market in a more honest way.",3,"01 2, 2014",1388620800,"[0, 0]"
"0316228532","A22Z2B17I28XV2","BookChick","Not a fan","Confession: I would have bought a copy of this book regardless of what it was about or how it was reviewed.  I adored the Harry Potter series, and I was interested to see what Rowling would chose as the subject for her first ""adult"" book.In this book, the death of parish council member Barry Fairbrother is the catalyst for a series of terrible events in the tiny English town of Pagford.  The adult community in Pagford is much more concerned about who will fill Barry's seat on the council than the fact that he's dead.  Apparently, Barry has been at the center of controversy over what the town should do with an area called ""The Fields,"" which is a poor housing development located between Pagford and the neighboring city of Yarville.  The election for a new council member brings skeletons out of the closet for several Pagford families.For a book about a small town, Rowling's cast of characters is huge.  She narrates from almost twenty different characters' perspectives, and she manages to give each one a unique voice.  The characters I found the most compelling were the teenagers.  Rowling pokes fun at people who take themselves too seriously.  She also hits on some political issues that are incredibly timely - one of the parish council members talks incredulously about how people in The Fields think they are ""entitled"" to housing, education, and medical care.I am NOT giving this book 2 stars because I think it was poorly written, or because I think the concept was bad, or because I'm mad at Rowling for writing something that wasn't another Harry Potter book.  I give this book two stars because I didn't enjoy the experience of reading it.  Every relationship in this book is flawed.  Parents emotionally or physically abuse their children.  Children rebel with drugs, sex, and embarrassing public revelations of family secrets.  Spouses are unfaithful.  Neighbors turn a blind eye to the people in their community who are suffering.  There is redemption for a few characters in the end of the novel, but not enough to satisfy me.  I know that's the way the world works - not everyone gets a happy ending, people don't learn from their mistakes, and sometimes ""bad people"" don't get what's coming to them.

I think part of the problem was that Rowling tried to include too many and wasn't able to go far enough into depth.2. The plot is flat, which would be bearable if there was something to make up for it, which there is not. A town clamoring for a local government position, all the while revealing secrets about one another has potential, but the execution is downright boring.3. Speaking of secrets, the scandals that result aren't really that appalling, nor are the responses of the townspeople.4. There are too many subplots, that, again, aren't done well. There's the overall political line, than one for each of the dozen or so characters. They all overlap and some end up just getting lost in the shuffle.5. The end is contrived and melodramatic. It's ridiculous.6. It's far longer than it should be. Rowling should have worked on tightening up her storyline, concentrating on a few characters, and chopping off a hundred and fifty pages (it's just over 500).7. The ""naughty"" parts are so terribly PG. I felt as if she felt obligated to include more adult aspects, but was a little unsure about how to write them.8. The social and political messages (people not having a say in government, the poor being misunderstood, communities not working for a common good) are there, but not inspirational. She could have taken a much better stance.I wanted to like this, despite the fact that I had little hope. It took my over ten days to read- I had no desire to pick up the book to keep going.

I was led to believe it had a comedic edge, but I failed to find anything funny in it.There is nothing new in this book-- drugs are bad; teens can be both self-centered and stupid; small towns are petty; poor people have a tough time of it; sex can be pointless and sad; many adults are disappointed with their lives. There is Rowling's message that our society is basically crap with screwed up priorities. Is this anything we have not heard before?If this is her gritty reality novel, it is ""gritty reality lite."" There is a danger in creating a novel with all unlikeable characters, but none as truly evil as she would have us believe-- and making no likeable character with which the reader can identify or care about.The heavy handedness starts with at least five mentions of a ""skeletal"" abbey on a hill (religion, and therefore, morality have been abandoned here, get it?) in the first 50 or so pages. There is the truly-saintly (but unrecognized as such, until it is too late) ""bad girl,"" and the obligatory ""tragic"" ending. All this leads to-- what?  I don't know.

But I don't like fantasy or science fiction or whatever category you might put the Harry Potter series into.  Just not my thing.But given that Rowling is immensely talented, I thought a novel for adults would be great.I struggled and struggled to finish this book.  Unfortunately, it is filled with too many characters, most of whom are not likeable at all.  In order to care about their daily trials and issues in their town, you first have to LIKE them as people and CARE about them.  Not so in this book.The issues were really so petty and boring...and I live in a very small town so I understand that petty things in small towns can become huge issues. But, that doesn't make the petty things interesting enough to be the basis of a novel. I'm sorry I spent so much for this book!Actually, I blame Rowling's editors.  Unfortunately, when a writer is VERY successful and popular, editors seem to leave their work alone, assuming that whatever they do will be good.Her editor should have stepped in and make her cut some characters and given redeeming values to others.If this is representative of her writing for adults, Rowling should not continue in that genre.

"0316228532","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","Bookphile","Dark and affecting","As a rabid fan of Harry Potter, I wasn't quite sure what to anticipate as I dove into this novel.  While I didn't expect it to be anything like Potter, I also didn't quite expect it to be anything like it is.  I can understand why some Potter fans don't like this book, as it is quite different, not just in subject matter (which I think everyone anticipated anyway, as Rowling was quite clear all along that this book was very different), but in tone.  Some minor spoilers to follow.This is a bleak book.  There's no other way to put it, really.  With the Potter books, even when things were extraordinarily dark, there was always a glimmer of hope underneath, a sense of goodness inherent to humanity, and several messages of redemption.  These things are somewhat present in this book, but not in the same way.  There's no need for a Voldemort in this book, because regular human beings do a fine job of destroying one another, whether it's through their outright malice or their casual indifference.  I think this book is a much more scathing exploration of the smallness of human nature, whereas the Potter books offered up beautiful glimmers of humanity.Another reason why I think this book may be difficult to love is that none of the characters are entirely loveable.  Unlike with Potter, where there were clear heroes, clear villains, and some villains who turned out to be not quite so villainous, the characters in this book are complex human beings, most of whom are motivated by their own petty selfishness and their sense of self-righteousness.  They are people who have been wounded and so feel the right to wound right back, no matter the consequences of their actions.However, as critical as that may sound, I thought this was actually an excellent book because it so affected me.  I kept reading, desperately hoping things would get better for Krystal and Robbie, or for Sukhvinder, that Fats/Stuart might wake up and realize the havoc he so casually wrought, that Ruth might find the strength to stand up to her husband, that Kay might finally wake up and realize how much Gavin was using her.  I sympathized with these characters at times, felt exasperated with them at others, and downright disliked them at still other moments.  But they were all so human.  I could identify with their struggles, and I wanted good things to happen for them all.  At various points, this book made me laugh, made me cringe, and made me cry--especially at the end.That, I think, is Rowling's true strength.  Her characters are so vivid, their emotions so authentic that you can't help but care, and care deeply.  Whether she's writing about a boy wizard or an angry woman wanting to punish her husband for his indifference to their marriage, Rowling gets at the heart of humanity with her writing, and it's a skill that I think is phenomenal.  To my mind, there is no question that Rowling can write, and write well.  I read a lot, and I enjoy many books, but it's far rarer for a book to really touch me, to really play with my emotions, and every book by Rowling that I've ever read has done this.  She is consistently able to not only tell me a story, but to make me feel.Still, it's not what I'd call a perfect book.  It takes some time to get into it, and I found the omniscient third person narrator very confusing at times, particularly when I'd read a scene with multiple characters and would find myself jumping from one character's head to another.  It took a while for me to remember which character was which and, even at the end of the book, I sometimes had to take a moment to connect the characters with their back stories.  This was a really ambitious book, and it had a few flaws that worked against it.While I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a light read that will restore your faith in humanity, I did think it was excellent.  Yet, I confess that, the next time Rowling writes something, I hope it'll be a bit happier.  I'm not sure I can take this level of misery on a regular basis.",4,"11 3, 2012",1351900800,"[6, 6]"
"0316228532","A2F6N60Z96CAJI","Bookreporter","Readers expecting the charm and magic of Harry Potter are in for a surprise","Imagine for a moment that you are J.K. Rowling. Your internationally bestselling novels about an orphan boy who attends an imaginary school for wizards and witches, over which you labored for 10 years, have sold hundreds of millions of copies. They have been translated into 73 languages and turned into eight blockbuster movies. Harry Potter is now and probably will remain a household name for decades. You are reportedly the richest woman in England (even richer than your queen), quite possibly the world. You are A-listed for every conceivable event on the planet. Would you rest on your laurels, perhaps buy a private jet and a yacht or two, and tour the world?Suppose instead that your life consists of an occasional commencement address and the rare television interview, but you would rather retain your privacy and work with disadvantaged children that harken back to your own humble beginnings. And your creative mind continues to nudge you that you still have stories to tell.This is how Rowling's eagerly awaited new novel, THE CASUAL VACANCY, came about. By virtue of her fame, over one million copies were pre-sold before the book hit the stores. Readers expecting the charm and magic of Harry Potter are in for a surprise. This serious, often dark and sometimes humorous novel is a tale of the inhabitants of the small, west England village of Pagford, similar to the one where Rowling grew up. She has brought them to life through a half-dozen middle-class families who share career, political and social ambitions. Their children attend the same schools; several are teenagers who live in their own worlds of cell phones, laptops and social networking. Between Pagford and a nearby medium-sized city that provides industry and commerce to the region lies a crumbling housing project known as The Fields. The Fields are rife with the problems attendant to poverty --- drugs, prostitution, alcoholism, unemployment, hopelessness --- and an especially poignant family, the Weedons.Pagford's governing council is led by its most popular and beloved councilman, Barry Fairbrother. Barry's unexpected death at age 42 brings about a rift in the community as selection begins to elect his replacement. The council was about to vote on the continuation of a controversial methadone clinic in The Fields, a project that Barry had strongly supported. This event becomes a tragic catalyst for destruction. Relationships between married couples, parents and their teenage children, and long-term friendships become frayed as the ghost of Barry Fairbrother seems to hover over the conscience of the village.There are no magic potions or wands in Pagford to mitigate the problems that lay just below the surface of the idyllic little village. The all-too-human inhabitants of Pagford are left to fend for themselves, as must we all. Rowling has turned her storytelling mastery to a subject that has made the book controversial in England. It is a story of the clash between classes and is very British in its view of the haves versus the have-nots. The humor, dialect and vocabulary are often colloquial, so if you are unfamiliar with British slang and phrases, you may be nonplussed on occasion. For instance, if one is not familiar with the difference between ""public"" and ""private"" schools in the UK --- the exact opposite of the American education system --- it can be confusing. Also, reference to ""living on the estate"" in England means that you live in publicly financed housing. Going home to the estate is not driving through the gates to your mansion containing rare works of art, a pool and tennis courts in Beverly Hills. It is far more likely to be a tenement whose art is defined by graffiti.Class consciousness is a popular theme of novels, even in America's coveted ideal of democracy. THE STARBOARD SEA, the acclaimed first novel by Amber McDermont, takes place in a similar American eastern small town. It is a story of class warfare between the privileged students of an exclusive boarding school and the ""townies."" Much like CATCHER IN THE RYE of an earlier era, these and books like them define the ever-present pecking order of the human condition. Will A CASUAL VACANCY by an author of the stature of J.K. Rowling compare? Only time will tell.Reviewed by Roz Shea",4,"10 15, 2012",1350259200,"[4, 4]"

I mean, I started reading it the day it came, even thought of pulling an all - nighter to make it more special or at least post this review with a bunch of special features. The reason I decided to treat this book like any other book was because it felt like any other book to me as I read it. A good novel for adults, I'm glad I read it and here's why:Rowling's writing style was, is and will always be fantastic. I just like discovering the hidden humor behind the words and between the lines. I like that she makes me laugh out loud or grin sullenly. The Casual Vacancy is a chunk of a book, but I never felt like taking a break or reading something different. I was never fed up with the story because Rowling lulled me into that world so fast - and then I started confusing it with my own. It all just felt so real and alive and I seemed to know the characters like I know my oldest friends. Sound familiar? Hehe...The actual plot and idea of the book surprised me but I think they were very well done, too. Rowling told like....ten (or probably more) different stories that all intertwined in a way and she still found the right words for every one of them. The issues in TCV were quite heavy...and the ending was quite disturbing, but then again it's pretty close to the real world (I would say).The only factor that makes me give this book two and not three Smarties is that after all there are books I enjoyed more. There's a reason I don't read adult books unless I'm forced to and there's also a reason for people calling The Casual Vacancy an adult book. Let's just say although the author did everything right it was just not my cup of tea.",4,"12 26, 2012",1356480000,"[0, 0]"

The contentious election that results to fill this position also acts as the vehicle for conflict between conservatives and liberals, the ""upper class"" and the ""lower class,"" husbands and wives, parents and children.  All of this culminates in a tragedy which forces everyone to reexamine their prejudices, their preconceptions, and their relationships with those closest to them.""The Casual Vacancy"" is not a children's story, like the Harry Potter series started out as, although kids make up many of the primary characters. It's also not a happy story; again like the Harry Potter series, there is a dark undertone running all throughout this novel. It deals with issues that many of us don't like to confront: violence, poverty, drug abuse, death, as well as the small, petty jealousies and rivalries that make up much of all human relations. If you only like happy endings in your reading, then this is not the book for you. You'll probably also be disappointed in this book if you're offended by swearing and sex, although you should keep in mind that Rowling is writing about REAL LIFE in this novel, and swearing and sex are often part of real life, whether you like it or not.While it's a depressing novel in many ways, it's also strangely cathartic. You finish it with a satisfying sense of wanting to learn to appreciate the good things you've got, and maybe even to be more understanding toward those less fortunate.

"0316228532","A1JPB4ZATC76VQ","Brittany Davis ""Brit""","Great Character Study","I think plot details have been reviewed pretty well by this time, so I'd like to comment on the characters.What I have always loved about Rowling's writing is her ability to create characters that seem real.  She knows her characters,she knows what to do with them, and she isn't afraid to let bad things happen to them. In this novel, she has dozens of characters to work with, and oftentimes background information has to be supplied and the actual plot suspended so that the reader can keep up with everyone.  I personally don't mind because I find these characters absolutely fascinating, but the lack of action isn't going to appeal to everyone.With many books it is very clear who the reader should be ""rooting"" for, since one character seems to stand above the rest morally or in talent.  If you are expecting the same formula in this book you will be disappointed, because each character is deeply flawed, each with his or her own ugliness.  My point is that there is no hero, unless you count the deceased Barry Fairbrother, and I even wonder about him.  Again, I find this refreshing.  It makes me irrationally annoyed to see so many bestsellers about a klutzy, yet otherwise completely endearing protagonist attracting all men within a ten mile radius.  You will not find that here.  Thank God.The counterpoint to this is that each character is also endearing or relatable in his or her own way.  With each shifting viewpoint (and there are many), new insights are revealed that make it easier to understand each character.  It is a style that makes it hard to put the book down, since she never gives you all you want to know at once.Other points: I'm a fast reader, and ordinarily I'd have knocked this out in a night, but I decided to stretch it out over a couple of days.  I really think this helps for understanding the characters and their connections better -- if you don't get those, you won't understand the plot.Also, many people are commenting on the use of strong language, sexuality, and rape.  Personally, I think if you are going to write about problems in a small town and the people in it, these things almost beg to be addressed.  That Rowling did not avoid them speaks to her strength as a character writer; it doesn't mean, for example, that she's using four letter words just because she can't think of a better one.",5,"10 9, 2012",1349740800,"[121, 137]"
"0316228532","A1XCKML984U44U","B. Roberts ""book muncher""","Good","Note: This review contains no spoilers about the plot.For me, the most surprising thing about The Casual Vacancy is how ordinary it is. It's not a great book, by any means, but it's not bad either. It's a well-written, slightly cliched book that entertained me while I was reading it, but which will probably not linger long in my memory; it's the kind of book you buy, enjoy, and then leave gathering dust on the shelf.It's a very traditional novel in every sense. The plotting is decent, although J.K. Rowling has a tendency to use un-subtle signposts that let the reader know something important is about to happen. The characters are quirky, if unrealistic. The author's moral view of the world is a little simplistic, which suits the uncomplicated tone of the whole book. This isn't a book that'll challenge your beliefs.There were moments where I felt that Rowling was trying too hard to come up with memorable and effective descriptions. Some passages are a little too long, and the emotion of the narrative is a little too carefully constructed to be truly effective. There are one or two lines that were obviously supposed to be clever, but which stand out and distract from the flow of the prose. I was never quite as immersed in the story as I'd have liked to have been, which was a shame because at the core of the book there's a very interesting tale.So J.K. Rowling hasn't embarrassed herself at all with this competently written book. I felt at times like Rowling herself was a character, because I could sense her trying very hard to slip the Harry Potter style, which means (unfortunately) that some of the attempts to introduce sexual elements felt forced, as if the author was desperate to prove a point. I'd recommend The Casual Vacancy, but try not to set your expectations too high. It'll entertain you and, so long as you're forgiving of the occasional mis-step, I think you'll enjoy the book. But I doubt it'll ever top anyone's lists of favourites.",4,"09 28, 2012",1348790400,"[59, 75]"

Rowling is the most financially successful writer of this generation, having penned the Harry Potter series which morphed into various forms of lucrative licensed entertainment.  The Casual Vacancy is a stylistic departure for Rowling.Set in contemporary England in a small country town, the title refers to an opening on the local parish council when a well-regarded seated member unexpectedly passes away.  The seeming idyllic village is in shock.  However, in the words of the late U.S. House Speaker Tip O&#8217;Neill &#8220;all politics is local&#8221;.  This is an apt description of the lives of those in this hamlet and applies to each who has a stake in the political game and those who are simply observers.Rowling excels at character development (there are many of them) and the reader is quickly absorbed in the sometimes sordid minutiae of the lives of principal and secondary characters.  As Rowling is British the lexicon has a decidedly English feel which reminded me of my years living in the East Anglia area of England.There are some major themes explored in this excellent book; among them, teen angst, poverty, drug use/abuse, infidelity and class privilege.

Yes, IT IS NOT Harry Potter (but actually, the characters and personality from those books are still present in this book.) I love the humor and the unique way JKR has of depicting her characters and breathing them life. My favorite character so far is Fats. I would compare this book to Zadie Smith'sOn Beautya book where you get to know various characters from many different generations, warts and all.Give the book a chance. Pretend it's not from JKR if that helps! Don't just tear it apart without reading it!Anyway, I'll come and update the review once I'm done with the book 100%. (And yes, I read the part about the unguarded vagina and it was hilarious!)---Alright, now I'm 2/3rds through with the book. I'm enjoying reading it a lot so I'm just savoring it and reading only a few chapters at a time, rather than rushing through to finish it. While I don't want to spoiler, I will definitely say that Fats is no longer my favorite character. I do love how JKR just painstakingly created real 3D personalities and backstories and motivations for this whole mob of characters though. I feel like I can't even pick who my favorite is! The character of Crystal is slowly drifting towards the forefront which contrasts nicely with how, in Harry Potter, it was OBVIOUS that Harry was the star. In the beginning of The Casual Vacancy, I only saw Crystal as a dirty little Dudley-esque (though attractive looking) minor-character. A mean girl of low intellect from a bad family. And DESPITE these facts, JKR is slowly molding her to be a sympathetic character. I think something like that takes lots of skill and I'm enjoying going on the ride.If I can draw an analogy from the real world, I do feel like this is JKR's 'Drew Barrymore moment.' Remember back in the early 90's when Drew Barrymore just got sick of doing little girl roles and started doing sexified roles in movies like Poison Ivy and The Amy Fischer Story? Most people were like WHAT IS SHE DOING? WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?? But in retrospect we realize that she just had to rebel and break away from that old mold and I feel like this is exactly what JKR is doing too. I do feel like she's over-doing it a little bit with the rude language and sexual content (there isn't much but when it's there, IT'S THERE RIGHT IN YOUR FACE.) And it's awkward like the rape scene fromI Am Charlotte Simmons: A NovelI wouldn't recommend this book to people who are more into action and less into scenes where people just stand around talking about each other. If this book were a movie, it would be a 6 hour miniseries because of all the tiny little character-developing scenes and interactions. To some people, that's very uninteresting and basically the 180 degree opposite of Harry Potter's adventures. Me? I like those kinds of books.

These are some of the issues J. K. Rowling writes about in ""The Casual Vacancy"", her first novel intended for an adult audience. And these are real-world issues even harder to overcome than Voldemort.The novel centers on the seemingly bucolic small English town of Pagford, whose prettiness lies mostly on the surface. Her characters  come from all classes of society, something I like in novels, and ""The Casual Vacancy"" explores the ways in which these very different characters interact and affect one another.The book begins with the death of Barry Fairbrother, one of the leaders of the parish council. The election to fill the vacancy left by his death brings to the forefront many of the tensions simmering in Pagford.  Some of the reviewers have mentioned that the people populating Pagford just aren't very likeable. By and large, this is true, but Rowling does an excellent job giving us insight into these characters and making them very real and understandable to the reader. I was reminded of a quote I once read. Unfortunately, I can't remember it exactly or give credit to the author, but the gist of it was that everyone, if we could see their privates thoughts, would seem like monsters. Well, Rowling lets us see inside her characters' heads. We see them in their pettiness, their jealousies and insecurities, their self-absorption and their delusions, and their delight in malicious gossip. But some of the characters, flawed though they may be, do try to do their best. When another major event occurs late in the novel, we  see that while some people remain unchanged and just as nasty as ever, others are capable of changing and growing for the better, giving the novel at least a slightly hopeful feel.I was thoroughly absorbed by ""The Casual Vacancy"", and I'm glad I wasn't dissuaded from reading it by negative reviews. I really admire Rowling for having the guts to write something so totally different from the Harry Potter books. I hope she continues to be true to herself and write what she wants.

My biggest issue with The Casual Vacancy is that there isn&#8217;t so much as a thin plot, but more like no plot.  The novel starts off with Barry Fairbrother dying in his small town in England, and the rest of the novel is people reacting to it.  It is full of people with petty concerns and unimportant things that they dwell on, but there is no actual story here.  Furthermore, there is not a single likeable character.  I have no idea who is supposed to be the protagonist or antagonist, but I didn&#8217;t care in the least for any of them.  This novel was so painful to read that I had to stop midway through.

RowlingThis is the story of a death:  The death of Barry Fairbrother, a member of the Pagford Parish Council and how it affects the town of Pagford.  Ms. Rowling introduces us the the very characters of the town:  Howard Mollison, first citizen of Pagford (in essence its mayor) - who was running the city and wanted to have the bad section of town called ""The Fields""--where low income people lived and drug addicts went to The Bellchapel Addiction Clinic for methadone supply--shut down and sent to Yarvil--the neighboring and bigger town.  This is also the story of Howard's son, Miles, and the Mollison dynasty.The fuzz is against Catherine (Terri) Weedon, a drug addict, and her daughter Krystal a 16 y/o girl who was coached by Barry on the Winterdown school rowing team.  They represent everything the Mollisons want to rid  Pagford alongside with The Field.As the death produces a casual vacancy:  ""What you call it when a council seat become vacant through a death."" (P. 35) factions ensue.  Howard wants The field to return back to Yarvil, and close The Bellchapel Addiction Clinic--mostly because Barry wanted it to stay open, and thus be good to Krystal--but also because Krystal had punched his granddaughter, Libby, and broken two if her teeth.Leading the fight to keep the clinic open after Barry's death, is Dr. Parmindel Jawanda--a General practitioner who was in love with Barry. she aligns with Collin (Cubby) Wall, Deputy headmaster of Winterton school.  But damning posts are hacked into the Pagford'ds website, thus ensuing tragedy for Colin, Pamindel, Simon, and Howard.  Their dirty laundry is exposed for all to see.Elections are held and both factions develop, particularly concerning whether to dissociate with ""The Fields"" -- which Barry supported an alliance with. However, those running for a place find their darkest secrets revealed on the Parish Council online forum by an user signing as The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother, ruining their campaigns and leaving the election in turmoil.  From the grave, all the lives of Pagford are affected by Barry.  As Howard says:  ""Barry and the ghost are one and the same, a troublemaker alive and dead.""  (p. 383).  In a nutshell--the book is about Barry Fairweather and how he was connected to all the citizens in Pagford.Ms. Rowling takes us to her climax just as when Miles Mollison takes over the empty Parish seat; but a set of erratic events deprive the Mollisons of their total victory.I did not enjoy the book.  I thought it was poorly written.  Ms. Rowling narrates the story by using different points of view; but she keeps switching points of view on you so that you never know who's actually doing the narrating.  It reads slowly and the plot is petty. It's also predictable.As a fellow writer friend of me wisely said:  ""...your first successful piece of writing is your best piece of writing--until you finally out achieve it with another piece of writing, terrifically new and phenomenally well done.""

Its only elements in common with the Harry Potter books are teenager protagonists and a British setting. Despite many warnings and careful marketing of the book to an adult audience, cries of vulgarity appeared almost immediately.I could review this book from several angles: the die-hard HP fandom perspective, where I'm angry it wasn't about Harry and the gang; the lit-crit viewpoint that loves unhappy endings and four-letter words; the JKR-hater who thinks she's a hack who should enjoy her pile of pounds in peace and never write again; and a thousand variations on those themes.Personally? I liked this book. It wasn't a fun book, but it wasn't meant to be a lovely romp through a meadow. Even in the most dire of situations, JKR's wit and clever descriptions shone. A large cast of characters and chapters from many POV made it a bit challenging to follow, especially when names were similar, but it wasn't a Russian drama.It's a solid follow-up to a series so beloved that any new work by the author would invite very intense scrutiny and the worst of magic-themed puns.

That is not to say that HP was not dark too but the fantasy in it was so entertaining that the darkness was more palatable.  This is very well written and is about the adults and the children of a small town in England who are thrown into control and class issues when one of the local politicians dies suddenly.  This is a town which was once all prosperously middle class or better but due to a political deal annexed some other territory which brought in lower classes. Those two classes are thrown together in this book, both teenagers and adults.Here's why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5: I think this author has the talent to have handled this like the classic Mapp and Lucia series by Benson, which contained some similar, but not quite so dark, material but such material was handled by Benson with absolutely brilliant wit. This story has some of that wit but pulls well short of full delivery. I almost gave up reading this when we had a lengthy home visit by a social worker to a lower class single mother and her sodden child.  This material was just depressing.  But it followed on the heels of some trenchant observations of all the townspeople sharing their views over the just dead fellow.  That was remarkably like reading Mapp & Lucia and I loved it. I also loved reading with ""Fats"" (because he is skinny) copes with having a father in administration and his mother as guidance counselor in the school were he too is stuck for the duration of his adolescence.  Finding out why the students call his father ""Cubby"" and hearing Cubby sob during an assembly over the decedent, reminded me of that other force of British wit, Wodehouse.But you can't mistake Rowling's talent.

At first the amount of rage against the middle-class characters shocked me.  I've never seen more cruel character portrayals or more vicious humor than Rowling directs against the Mollisons, for example.  But then I began to recall what it was like to feel as helpless as Krystal Weedon and as terrified of ending up like Terri Weedon, before  I found a teacher who cared enough to help me surmount my dyslexia (thanks, Mr. Miller!) and later professors from the lower classes  who spent the time with me I needed to learn to solve problem with words. Rowling is cruel to the cruel and speaks for those who can't write books.  She deeply explores what the loss of Barry Fairbrother, who thought everyone was at least as valuable as he was, does to a community of smug, selfish, judgmental, over-privileged creeps.  And it's balm for the soul of everyone who has ever had to contend with similar communities.  If you feel sick with anger when you see the top 10% pinching up their faces in distaste as they step over the homeless lying in the street on their way into boutiques and expensive cafes, then you'll enjoy this cathartic novel.

"0316228532","A2XNZ8PF6R8ZCY","Carpe Librum","Spent too much time waiting for something to happen...","If this book was written by someone other than J.K. Rowling I never would have looked twice at it. Maybe I should have gone with that instinct. This book was over 500 pages of waiting for something to happen.Let me give credit where credit is due. Rowling develops amazing characters. The Casual Vacancy is about a small town where everyone knows each other, they are certain their little town in the best place on earth, and things fall apart when one person unexpectedly dies. Rowling takes us deep into the psyche of about a dozen of these townspeople, young and old, and she does it remarkably well. Each of them has some dark emotional issue that they are dealing with, and they are written so well that it made me wonder whether Rowling herself could be sane to be able to portray them so well.Unfortunately, these characters never seem to really do anything. We read hundreds of pages of their daily lives with some minor drama, but the final climactic moment has little to do with everything else that has taken place. That's not completely true. The rest of the novel shows how every person is so wrapped up in their own little world that they either do not notice or do not care when tragedy is unfolding right before their eyes. They make us think about how easy it is to discount someone and decide they are not worth our time and effort. A valuable lesson, but one that Rowling took a long time in getting around to.If you are looking for an example of superb character development (say if you are a writer yourself), then I would recommend this book. Otherwise, you may spend hours turning pages thinking surely something is going to happen soon, only to be continually disappointed.",2,"04 19, 2013",1366329600,"[2, 3]"

I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, but it was never the writing itself that enthralled me, but rather the plotting and the characters. Within a few pages of The Casual Vacancy there were several turns of phrases where I sat back and thought, &#34;Wow. Wow, she's a really good writer.&#34;I can see why this book isn't for everyone - it is, more than anything else, a character study. It just so happens that that is one of my very favorite types of books. WHAT is happening isn't so important as who it is happening to, and how all of these people interconnect. And the small English town of Pagford is a perfect setting for that kind of intricate web.And what is really impressive to me is that every single character is a shade of gray. She accomplishes this with shifting points of view constantly, which usually is dizzying, but she handles deftly. The characters who seem truly horrible by all of their behavior, when we get into their heads they are... well, still kind of horrible, but you at least see how they're real people with real motivations. There isn't a hero in this book. Isn't a 100% likeable character anymore than there is a 100% unlikeable character (though some come close). I honestly didn't know who I was rooting for, or even if that was an appropriate thing to be doing.People who read this book with any kind of expectations based on Harry Potter will be sorely disappointed.

I do not give up on books...I read to the very end of every book, hoping the author will pull out something of value. I was interested in reading The Casual Vacancy to see what JKR had to say to an adult audience. My first thought upon finishing this book was that JKR should stick with fantasy children's books.What I liked about the book was that the characters were real, in that they are all flawed and I enjoyed reading about their lives from each of the main character's viewpoints. It was a new plot - dealing with small town politics, 21st Century issues, and how all the character relationships impact one another. This is not a fluffy read.Disappointments....from the beginning there were too many characters introduced, with viewpoints switching back & forth, and name switching (referring to characters nicknames, full names, family last names, etc. I had to keep stopping and think, ""who is she referring to"") It took awhile for me to wrap my head around who was who, and in the end there were only a couple of characters that I cared about. I am typically a complete sap, cheering for characters, believing in them, crying for them - but not in this book. I was saddened by the outcome of some of the characters but did not shed a tear. I found parts of the story quite predictable.",3,"11 17, 2012",1353110400,"[1, 3]"
"0316228532","A11II5ED402DRZ","Cassidy Fontana","Given public opinion, I almost feel like I should apologize for more or less liking this book...","This an incredibly difficult book to review, because I had such mixed feelings about it over the course of reading. In the beginning, I found it surprisingly vulgar (not just because it's JKR, but more so than many other adult books I've read), and I also thought it was somewhat slow. To an extent the vulgarity comes from the kinds of characters Rowling portrays, but in my opinion she takes it further than she has to.That being said, by the end the book had become something of a pageturner for me (though not for everyone), and I wanted to find out what happened. It is remarkable that characters I didn't like or identify with became people I actually cared about by the close of the novel. Despite the amount of people Rowling follows throughout the book, I never did find a character I identified with, which was unexpected. Ironically, it is the exact opposite in the Potter series - even the antagonists are appealing and likeable in a certain way.Obviously this book has nothing to do with Harry Potter or the Wizarding World, and when readers compare the two, the Casual Vacancy looks even bleaker, because not everything works out in this world, and the good guys don't always win. The novel is in a completely different genre for a vastly different audience, and if you can accept it on those terms, you stand a chance of enjoying it, although it is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and would have been a hard sell even without the shadow of the Potter books looming over it.It is not a murder mystery as some early descriptions portrayed it, although it does have kind of a ""Desperate Housewives"" meets Jane Austen feel in terms of the sly humor Rowling uses to depict modern-day small town English society. While the characters are developed, they are also purposely caricatures, parodying real life. Samantha, Shirley, and Maureen are the gossipy women whose cheeks flush with excitement when they hear about the neighbors' tragedies - there is a particularly funny moment when Maureen hears an ambulance and steps outside, hoping ""to taste the tang of disaster,"" not realizing the ambulance is for a loved one of hers.Andrew and Gaia, two teenagers, were some of my favorite characters to follow because they had redeeming qualities. Andrew is angry but justifiably so, because his father Simon beats him, and simultaneously he has a sweet quality when pining after beautiful Gaia, who originally lived in London. Gaia is angry her mother Kay made her move to tiny Pagford, especially since Kay did it for a man, Gavin, who is barely interested in her. Kay is shown as dependent, clingy, and controlling with Gavin, yet we see a whole other side of her when she becomes the social worker for the Weedons, one of the families that live in the Fields, the poor, dilapidated area of town. As a social worker, Kay is firm but kind, and tries to work with the Weedon family instead of against them.Krystal Weedon is loud, reckless, confused, unrefined, and often offensive to people around her, though not necessarily intentionally. Barry Fairbrother, the councilman who died at the beginning of the novel, had taken Krystal under his wing as the rowing coach at her school. He had a positive fatherly influence on her, and she took his death very hard. Krystal makes countless mistakes, often alarmingly costly ones, but many of them stem from ignorance, poor judgment, and desperation.There are so many characters that it would be difficult to discuss them all, but at heart this is a psychological character novel. Tessa the school counselor has a compassionate point of view that is easy to latch onto when likeable characters are hard to come by. Her teenaged son, Fats, best friends with Andrew, is genuinely concerned with being as authentic as possible, but he takes this to the extreme, letting his ego get the best of him to the point that he believes he can do whatever he wants without consequences. It seems a huge oversight that Tessa, as a counselor, never tried to get Andrew to talk about his father Simon's rages, because she had seen a glimpse of one when the boys were younger. Instead, Andrew tries to deal with his father's abuse on his own.Teenaged Sukhvinder, whose family is Sikh, struggles with extreme self-hatred and bullying at school. Her tale is wrapped up a bit too neatly when she attempts to play hero in a dire situation. I was surprised to feel sympathy for Samantha Mollison, one of the gossipy women mentioned above, who organically gets a crush on one of the members of a boy band that her daughter likes, in part because she isn't getting anything out of her marriage and has realized that her husband is a bit of a buffoon. She begins to have a secret inner world and plots a way to see the band in concert on their tour.Because it's Rowling, I expected her to do something with the ruined abbey at the top of a hill in Pagford. It's described several times, but never plays a pivotal role. The description of Andrew and Fats' hideaway, in contrast, is so treacherous that I was unsurprised to see it reemerge near the end of the novel during a climactic scene.I give this book four stars because I did end up enjoying it, independently of the Potter novels, but at the same time, I expect the majority of people to give it a three or two star rating. In my opinion it is as well written as an average adult novel, though more predictable than Potter, and I was not moved to tears like I was during the last three HP books. It is great to see Rowling tackle completely different topics, and despite the backlash she's receiving from moving outside of the public's comfort zone, I think she has succeeded in what she was trying to do.",4,"10 12, 2012",1350000000,"[3, 3]"

But I think I had fewer expectations than some other readers that Rowling's adult work would be ""nice"".  It isn't.  And that's ok.  A writer whose work for children was accused of being ""too dark"" and ""too scary"" isn't going to write something sweetly pretty for adults.With such different topic matter, it would be unfair to draw comparisons, yet it is almost inevitable that we will.  Like the HP books, there is humour here... but it's sardonic humour.  Like the HP books, there is a willingness to describe the unpleasantness of people... but less focus on good conquering evil.  And like the HP books, there is death here too... but not the glorious deaths that occur in a battle against evil; in Casual Vacancy the deaths are hopeless, helpless, and despairing.  They leave unfinished business, and messy, unsolvable problems.  But that, surely, is the whole point; that life is like that, people are like that, and it behoves us to make the best we can of what we have, both for ourselves and for others.Perhaps the worst that can be said about Casual Vacancy is that it shows traces of the fact that Rowling didn't have to write it - it doesn't appear quite as finely honed as the HP books, and at times (particularly in the first half of the book) it lacks their compulsive pace.  I found myself much more aware of Rowling's skill as a writer in Casual Vacancy, and much less engaged in the story - perhaps because there really isn't a huge amount of story.  Lots of character insights and introspection, but not a complex or sustained plot line, which unfortunately leaves the skill a little too obvious when it ought to be concealed.  The last 20% of it is very impressive, though, and lifted it from 3 stars to 3.5 in my view.  I gave it four in the end because I felt there were so many unfairly negative reviews that I decided to over-estimate rather than under-estimate.But all in all, Rowling has written a raw portrayal of the underbelly of civilisation, and the conflict between petty meanness and courage.

Now this is just my opinion, but I think that ""something"" was a desire for truth; raw, unadulterated authenticity that can only be weaved into a story such as this. Again, that's just my opinion not the words of the author._A Casual Vacancy_ is NOT Harry Potter. It is not filled with adolescent adventure, although Rowlings has placed her teen characters front and center in this book and speaks ""loudly"" through them  (I kind of think she cannot get away from the thought of having teens express themselves in her work; although be warned, these teens are hardcore). There are a lot of F-bombs, sex, drunkenness, drug use, etc.  It builds slowly and methodically, then drops a bombshell at the end (albeit as predictable as it was...it was still startling.)In this book Rowlings gives us a look into the psyche of a small town person-by-person. She not only describes what they look like, but also takes her time detailing their backgrounds, what they are thinking at a given moment, how they move, and even includes flashbacks from prior life events in order to give us a fuller understanding of why they do what they do.  The town itself even takes on a persona, as we are given its background, and a description its mood and adversaries. This kind of detailing causes the book to move slowly; it's not action-packed book by any means, rather it's a reactionary account of the citizens of Pagford regarding the ""casual vacancy"" available on the town council due to the death of Barry Fairbrother.  My opinion is that after knowing them all so well, thanks to the extra padding Rowlings has given us, the ending made me realize there are two sides to every story. Yes, we all know this, but when was the last time you read a book that really made you FEEL that way; one that really made you think? As I kept reading, I began to become very curious about the fate of these wacky citizens. They are so wrapped up in their small town shenanigans that they completely lose perspective and get swallowed up by their own actions.This is why I don't get the 1-star reviews. Although it lacks the wittiness, excitement and adventure Rowlings is known for, it really is superbly written. Give it a try, but be patient, and bear with her as she delves into the extraneous details.",4,"10 15, 2012",1350259200,"[2, 4]"

I'm not down with all the JK hype, I just wanted a decent read, and I knew she was a good writer having consumed four HP books.""Casual"" is easy to read fast with lots of dialogue and short sentences. (It would be a good plane read.) She really does know how to write.  The ""but"" is that every social issue is thrown into the blender in this one without much build to it. Another reviewer described it as a hot mess. She's taken her pen and injected it with vaccines (a disease causing agent) of all kinds, that is, all of the vices in middle Britain (and middle America).  It's like the story is full of grinches and you're wondering whether there is a Mary Lou Who to save the day.  Unlike good vs. evil though, she's constructed evil vs. evil (or slimy vs. slimmier) in a Darwinian sort of warfare. It quickly shapes up to, ""who will win out"". It's worth reading, but it tries too hard to do too much. It's like a smash up of Zadie Smith meets Jonathan Frazen meets Wally Lamb.

"0316228532","A1SOTZ6RW88HO4","Chardonnay @ Thoughts and Pens Book Blog ""~Ch...","It was ok but didn't captivate me like HP has","PlotI will be biased on this one.  There are so many things in this world that I do not like and number five on that list is Politics.  This is the primary reason why it took me 2 weeks to finish reading the book that could have been read for 2-3 days.  While reading through the pages of TCV, I kept losing energy to scroll down to the next page. I admit that I was never a fan of politics and all I have for it is hatred.Reading TCV was like walking in oblivion where you just give up trying to determine the kind of direction that you wanna go to.  Perhaps I'm crazy or just plain old stupid but I failed to grasp the whole point of the book.  So Barry Fairbrother, the old good Parish Councillor, died.  And almost everyone developed self-interest on the vacancy his death had created.  And a war between pro and anti-Barry and his ideals suddenly engulfed the little town of Pagford.  Within the two warring camps, mini-wars are also been waged between married couples, parents and children, teenagers to teenagers, friends to friends, etc.  In addition to that, there's also rape, prostitution and poverty issues that need to be solved. There are a lot of conflicts in the book that while reading through it, you'll just find yourself lost and had to make hasty reviews of the previous pages.  In simpler words, there are a lot of conflicts in the book that failed to connect at the end.For example, I could not quite fathom the necessity to kill Krystal Weedon (one of the important characters of the story) for something that is not related to the purpose of the book. The reason of her death was because of her own stupidity and selfishness and was not in any way related to the main conflict of the book.  At the end of the story, it did not solve if Bellchapel clinic would remain to cater the rehabilitation of all drug abuser or if the Fields will be transferred to the jurisdiction of Yarvil. It did not even provide a clear solution whether her mother, Terri Weedon, had come to her senses and turned a new leaf from her heroin addiction.  And most importantly, how was Krystal's death impacted the local election of Pagford and the intentions of those people who are in the Parish Council Seats?  Alas, there's only a little impact.And there was Miles, who finally won the election not because he was good but because he was just the winner of all losers who run for the casual vacancy.  In the end, there was no mention what kind of steps he'll be taking to improve the quality of living in Pagford and most importantly, did the events of the book changed his  views on the Fields and Bellchapel Clinic?There are so many things that I would like to question about TCV.  About how some scenes were more like fillers than being essential to the portrayal of the whole plot.  And as I am typing this review right at this moment, I am feeling the itch to delete the whole document because I could not even properly arrange my thoughts about the book. It was confusing, like a magic spell that gone haywire.I suggest that if you want to know the whole story, please do the obvious and read it.CharactersSo after the plot disappointed me, I am in for another disappointment with the characters.  There are so many of them that I failed to empathize with any of them.  The characters were either shallow or self-centered or arrogant or just plain stupid. I do not even like Mary Fairbrother, who, even at the death of her husband remained unforgiving.  Seriously, isn't there someone on the book who has the slightest redeemable quality? The oldies were even annoying as the teens.Sometimes, you love the book because of its plot eventhough the characters are so darn hateful. But TCV has neither plot nor characters to love about.  Pagford is full of people who are self-righteous, self-centered, and arrogant.  Thus, you wonder why that Pagford is still there and not crumbling into pieces.Interaction and DialogueWell, the only redeemable thing about TCV is that I find the interactions and dialogue of the characters witty and funny.  And eventhough, some of the dialogues weren't the type to pass for an intelligent convo, it gave me this feel-good feeling.  I guess I have to give JK Rowling the salute for always making conversations and interactions among characters interesting, funny and at the same time, sad.I especially like the interactions between the Mollison family (Howard, Shirley, Miles, Samantha and well, Mo).  And that of the Price family.  The first family appeared to be united but on a deeper sense, they are very much divided. Like how Shirley disliked Sam and vice versa.  Like how Sam disliked his own husband Miles.  And who would ever forget about the Price family? The brutal, sadistic and stupid father Simon Price and his wife who stopped using her brains.  And Andrew Price, the acne-faced son, who I'm not really sure if he is on her mother or father's side.Overall ImpressionBecause of the effort and the interesting dialogues, I give TCV three (3) stars.  The book could have saved its face if:The ending did not make us hanging on a cliffhanger.The plot was not that complicated, having a lot of corners to turn and only to find out that it's a dead end.There's one character that emerged a hero/heroine at the end. I don't see Krystal or Sukvhinder or Arf or Price falling into that category.The characters weren't so many that while reading the book, you feel like you're drowning from memorizing all the names of the character.Moral Lesson of the StoryThis is a new portion of my book review which I have forgotten to add into my previous reviews.  As I have said in the ""About Me"" Section, there are no crap books.  Critiquing a novel is always based on your personal opinion and is therefore, subjective.  Aside from being a work of art,  books are a great way to pick up moral lessons that in one way or another teach us something as we go on with life.  No matter how frustrated I am with the book, there's always the silver lining out there and that is, I will learn something from what I've read.TCV is actually a perfect depiction of the ""everything is connected to everything"" concept.  Our every action produces consequences that do not only affect us but also affect (directly or indirectly) everyone and everything around us. This teaches us to be always mindful of our actions and anticipate the likely consequences.Second, TCV teaches us one of the most basic lessons in this world: the importance of the parents' guidance on a growing child. In TCV, we saw how the little town of Pagford was rocked because of the actions of teenagers who were neglected and abused by their parents.  Had they been treated with care and positively supported by their parents, things in Pagford could have happened differently... less trauma, no deaths and a better community.",3,"09 2, 2013",1378080000,"[0, 1]"

Okay, I knew that, but deep down I was envisioning some of the ... magic in the world of Harry Potter would be evident here - but this is truly an adult book where honesty is more valuable than beauty.  It's real life, and it's harsh.  It was a little difficult to get into because of the vast array of characters who interact against the backdrop of the parish council election.  And J.K. Rowling takes her time masterfully shaping and delineating each character, creating a characteristically intricately plotted story which weaves the lives of at least twenty people into a varied, lively tale of the every day.  This novel is like a soap opera full of drama, petty jealousies, sex, drugs, abuse and adolescent rage.  Every private thought is revealed to the reader through the omniscient narrator making every failing of each character clear.At the heart of the political debate behind the election is the clashing lifestyles of the middle class and the very poor.  It's a look into where the line is drawn between handouts and civic duty to your fellow man.  How much care we should give to our neighbors, and when must we expect them to take care of themselves.  There is no easy answer and there is not one provided in this book.  This book just looks at the people who suffer under the system and it seems like it's everybody.This is a challenging and thought-provoking book, heavily dependent on realistically-portrayed characters and real-life issues.  It is tragic and darkly humorous, but not without some hope and charm.  Some of the characters are pompous and self-aggrandizing, wrapped up in their own small world-views, and the hope stems mostly from the younger characters who are not yet completely corrupted.  And yet for some it is too late.  There is so much in this book that makes you think about life at every stage, and though it didn't touch me on a deep emotional level, I admire it very much as a tremendous work of art.",4,"10 1, 2012",1349049600,"[9, 12]"

"0316228532","AYRVNG0ZZLU4C","Charles W. Brice ""Charlie Brice""","Worth the Effort","A Casual Vacancy is structured like a Victorian novel: many characters written in the omniscient point of view so that the author can slip in and out of the minds of each character. The book is complex and multilayerd. JKR begins with the death of Barry Fairbrother, a councilman in the small down of Pagford. His death causes ripples to move through the cauldron of pettiness that is Pagford revealing the truth behind the facades of many of the most prominent members of the community. This book comes the closest of any I've read in years of replicating the experience of being a psychotherapist, of learning what most lives are really about behind their appearances. JKR's psychological acumen is outstanding, especially when portraying the dynamics between prominent hypocritical parents and their mostly dramatically disturbed offspring. In the character of Simon Price, she presents the best depiction of a malignant narcissist I've ever read. The first 60-80 pages are difficult because the author presents many characters (reminiscent of Richard Russo) and the reader must work to keep them straight, but the labor involved is more than richly rewarded. I'm afraid that the books mixed reviews are coming from reviewers (even from some of our most prominent newspapers) who simply don't want to spend the time on complex novels that can't be speed read. God knows what these reviewers would have done with Dostoevsky or Tolstoy. They certainly lose patience with other brilliant authors - Murakami, for instance.

I have been on the fence as to just how I was going to rate this book, but then my wife said I should look at the books I have rated 3 stars and see if this would fit with those. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I didn't enjoy this as much as any of the books I previously gave three stars. So this is why I gave it two.Honestly, I don't have much to say about this book other than this just wasn't for me. I knew going into this that it wasn't something I would normally read but I wanted to give it a try. I am not one of those people who didn't like the book because they expected it to be Harry Potter, I actually liked the fact this was going to be nothing like the HP series so I thought I would enjoy this a bit more than I did. What it came down to was that this was a character study, and I am just not a fan of those. I need more action, or a deeper plot than filling a seat on the town government. Yes the characters are deep and have issues all there own but I was bored and really should have just quite and moved on. Still, I am stubborn and finish what I start, but I also wanted to give JK Rowling the chance to wow me.The two star rating is purely because I didn't enjoy this book. I am not saying this was a bad book, I just didn't enjoy it. I do have a few good things to say about this book. JK Rowling is an amazing author. Her talent is clearly evident in this book, and it was very well done. My biggest praise for her would be her characters and how she transitions from each point of view. Her characters are all very well developed and they each have their own personalities. This is a rare quality in an author and only a few I read can do this. She also does a great job transitioning between each character's story. I have read other books that are very heavy with characters and they just can't seamlessly transition like Rowling did. With these other works I found myself lost and having to go back and re-read. I was not lost once while reading this book. I will not slam an author especially on a review of another author's work so I won't be putting examples of poor character transitions.I will finish with this; Clearly Rowling is trying to show she is not just a writer of young Adult fiction. The language in this book is very heavily vulgar, and not what I was expecting. Now I am not offended by any of this, but if I was playing a drinking game for every vulgar word I would have been drunk a quarter of the way through. This is not a bad book, I was just bored. If you like character studies then I would recommend this for you. If you are like me and you need a deeper plot, or more action I would say give this a pass.",2,"01 12, 2013",1357948800,"[2, 3]"

It felt like she got to a deadline and simply stopped. Instead we are left with a deeply depressing ending with nothing learned and nothing gained by any of the central characters.

This is first adult novel by J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books. It was quite the detour from those books, so I think lots of the readers when into it assuming it might have a hint of HP in there, and I think the Amazon reviews show this (around 800 for each of the stars). I've read a lot of witty, British novels, and compared to those this was a pretty good book.Based in a quiet, pretty, little English town, a member of the parish council suddenly dies, and the town is left to battle out who will take his spot. This novel is heavy with characters, and thought I often got confused as to who was who, Rowling writes incredibly strong personalities, creating a very believable dramatic plot line.It's a big book, and I struggled through some of it, but over all enjoyed it. I think this shows the breadth of styles in which Rowling can write, so it will be interesting to see if she writes another book in this genre, or something else entirely.I would suggest this for fans of Sophie Kinsella novels, Gone Girl, and Bridget Jone's Diary.",5,"07 4, 2013",1372896000,"[0, 0]"

Yesterday I eagerly went to my local bookstore where there they sat--big, thick copies of this wonderful sounding story.  I picked up my copy, bought it, and returned home to began to read.  What a disappointment it turned out to be!  Sure there were lots of characters but I didn't feel any sympathy toward them.  And the language!  No thanks, I don't need to read all that profanity and tasteless talk. Why couldn't this adult book be written for grown-ups?  Why is something considered ""adult"" because it is filled with tasteless profanity* just for the sake of it i.e. the F bomb ad nauseum?  We expect our children not to talk that way and read that stuff but as adults we accept it?  I guess I had hoped that Ms Rowling's story would be along the lines of other British writers such as Rosamunde Pilcher or Maeve Binchy.  Oh well, I'll have to just reread The Shell Seekers or Circle of Friends.One more thought, it is a shame that such a wonderful writer of children's books had to write her first ""adult book"" in this manner.  I wonder how many children will be so curious to read it and in doing so be quite sadly surprised and disappointed that their favorite author writes such garbage.*(In my original review I had used the term ""bathroom talk"" because isn't that what children get a kick out of--saying ""naughty words""?

She's funny, and I loved most of all the ""life lessons"" of good-vs-evil, with there being both real evil and real good; imperfect characters who strive to do the right thing.  We cheer for the hard but fair teachers like Minerva McGonogal and Dumbledore.  We love the devoted (though far from perfect) families.This book is clearly from the same pen.  Good writing.  Funny, witty.  Layered, interweaving story.  But... no good-vs-evil... just lots of casual evil v slightly less evil.  No good teachers who are hard and fair, really.  No functional families.  I get what she's trying to do, I think-- to convey a sense of having to help the unfortunate as part of maintaining human hope & decency, NOT merely to see our efforts ""work.""  She successfully shows much strife for the mean pettiness it is.WAY too much swearing.  Way too much graphic sex-- or casual sex, or mention of sex, or mention of thoughts of sex.  Way too much graphic everything.  (Many times the f-bomb dropped right in the middle of Jesus' name, which is offensive to me).  It reminded me of Daniel Radcliff (who played HP in the movies) going out and riding a horse naked on stage the second he turned 18, trying too hard to prove ""I'm NOT a child actor anymore!""Rowling could have done all the things she set out to do without going overboard on the sex & violence.  I felt dirty reading this book.I swapped it out for ""Kisses for Katie,"" the true story of a teenager who has started a faith-based ministry feeding & schooling children in Uganda as well as adopting 13 girls... by age 22.

Pagford is the center (centre) of their existence, and everyone knows everyone else's business. But, once the doors are closed, families are hiding secrets that are crippling. Children are abused, mental illness rules, dissatisfaction and sadness. Small meanness keeps some hearts forever closed.Add to this, the fear we in the US see when we talk about poor people, drug abuse, welfare concerns. As a deeply-involved character study, this book looks at politics and the lengths people will go to avoid having to let go of preconceived notions of others.The Council of Pagford is gearing up for an ugly battle over The Fields -- a neighborhood that is legally a part of Pagford, a neighborhood of poor people with few prospects and few champions on the Council -- especially since Barry Fairbrother, a Fields success story, dies in the first scene. Barry is one of those stories 'reformers' love to tell...he grew up without much hope, but he fought for opportunities and he made something out of himself. His mission in life, before his unfortunate death, was to give a hand-up for others in the Fields, to show others they can do it too. This is not a welcome message for Howard, Barry's principal rival on the Council. He wants to shut down services to the people in the Fields and cut them loose from any support.With Barry's death, an opening in the Council becomes the prize for pro-and anti-Fields townspeople. We see the machinations behind the scenes and men in Pagford begin considering their own run.One of the criticisms of the book is the fact there are so many characters. I found it hard at first to keep track, so I made a chart to refer back to. This is one of those elements that reminded me of the old films Mom and I watched...SEEING the actors would be much easier than reading the names. If there was a character Rowling should have cut, I'd love for someone to give me that name. Every one added authenticity to this town. Every one contributed to the shattering climax.I found myself drawn to the young people...friends and classmates in the school the Pagford community wants to keep 'pure', code for 'free of Fields' kids.'Simon decides to run...but will his horrendous abuse, temper, and illegal dealings come out? His son Andrew hopes so.Colin decides to run...the assistant headmaster of the school...but his wife seems to brood on a secret she fears will come to light. Their son ""Fats"" is a walking time bomb, aimed in his parents' direction.Miles, Howard's son, has the inside track and seems to be blithering toward the office.Gumming up the works for everyone is Krystal Weedon. Krystal is a posterchild for what's wrong with the Fields: addict mother who turns tricks, anger issues, mouth of a sailor. She's also a shining example of a Fields child who can be saved: a good heart, devotion to her little brother and great-grandmother, smarts, and athletic ability.We see the pettiness of prejudiced people...their fear of people who are difference, their meanness, their back-stabbing. Their inability to see from someone else's point of view. Their eagerness to throw away people who are different.The Fields are inhabited by the 47%. People who ARE struggling, people who have (some of them) given up. Rowling does a masterful job of showing how hard it is to nurture hope when the world seems to be against you. Exactly how often is a person supposed to get back up when the world beats you down, and there's no one with a helping hand? But she shows us there is much worth saving...if the policymakers will have the Christian courage to love their neighbors. I found the parallels to our own country uncomfortably compelling.I was fascinated by her young people and their internal struggles...every one, despite the home he or she might live in, lives an internal life of fear and pain, of anger and revenge. They learn revenge hurts everyone, but I have the most hope for the teens. I fear for their parents...I'm not sure much has been learned.The community's indifference and self-centeredness contribute to the ultimate tragedy.I loved this book...the complicated characters, every one a full-drawn, rounded character, the relationships, the DALLOWAY-like crossing of the characters as she draws us from one scene into another. The glimpse into British politics. The lesson that humans are more alike than we're different.flag",5,"10 13, 2012",1350086400,"[5, 5]"

This contemporary fiction is set in the seemingly idyllic English village of Pagford, where the sudden death of Parish Councillor, Barry Fairbrother creates a casual vacancy on the parish council. As subsequent events are narrated from the points of view of various different characters, the picture emerges of a village whose inhabitants are not all satisfied with their lot in life, a village of simmering tensions waiting to boil over. Rowling's characters are easily recognisable as the denizens of the typical English village, but at the same time, show individual depth and appeal (or repugnance, as the case may be). And it seems quite a few of the characters have a secret (or two). The setting, characters and events will resonate with readers, and these same happenings drive the characters to desperate actions that ultimately result in tragedy for some. Rowling manages to pack quite a lot into this novel: she has an obese megalomaniac, drug addicts, computer-savvy teens, a fawning wife, a violent husband and father, an anxious teacher, and a caring social worker, to name just a few. There is domestic violence, rape, racism, corruption, self-mutilation, bullying, gossip, teen pregnancy, child abuse and SQL injection.

At times, it felt almost like she was trying to prove that she could write for adults.  There are graphic scenes of drug use, violence, and sex.  It reads almost like Trainspotting at times.The story is centered a seemingly ideal town in rural England, and focuses on everyone's issues and problems.  For me, that was one of the biggest flaws with the book.  Rather than pick a single character- Rowling insists on telling EVERYONE's story- pretty much simultaneously.  I don't mind multiple viewpoint novels (George R.R. Martin comes to mind), but Rowling's use of it in Casual Vacancy is haphazard.  She jumps points of view dozens of times within each chapter- sometimes switching in the middle of a paragraph.  On top of that, there is absolutely no one to identify with.  By the end of the book there were some characters I pitied, or hoped turned out ok- but even then there weren't many  characters that I actually liked.  Wading through a 500 page book that's switching rapidly between fairly awful people was tough at times.  In all honesty, if this had been written by anyone else, I probably would have stopped reading halfway through.Despite all of that, I still give it three stars.

She's the author with the million-dollar idea of a bespectacled magical boy. Literally, a multi-million dollar idea.With such a platform already built, branching out into a new genre, adult fiction, was a leap someone with her status was able to take without fear of failure. I'd like to believe as an author, she does worry if her work will be accepted or rejected by the masses, but that worry does not include her financial status.The Casual Vacancy is a triumph for Rowling. Keep writing. Please.The Novel:The premise of the novel centers around the death of Barry Fairbrother, who dies unexpectedly in his early forties. Being all of this takes place in the very small town of Pagford, the little idyllic English abode is in shock (apparently, small towns are the same everywhere). Barry was every man's man, and every woman's secret crush. He had a way of ingratiating himself upon people be it with fine talk, a cajoling laugh, or a kindred spirit. He was noted as the living embodiment of a self-made man that harbored no arrogance about it. And his death reveals all the vengeance that has been swept under the rug for years in Pagford because his death leaves an open seat on the council, and political battles reveal the deep demons festering in the hearts of every citizen existing among the cobbled streets and ancient abbey. This empty seat soon becomes the catapult of a full-blown town war. Awaiting with baited breath who will fill this seat takes the reader into the minds of Pagford's citizens from the rich to the poor, the educated and uneducated, and the self-proclaimed high to the very, very low. The book is thought-provoking with regular twists and turns. A solid read.The Review:For me, the book started strong. I felt an immediate connection to the characters and even though Barry Fairbrother's death occurs early in the novel, I felt sadness for his departure. This is a testament to the brilliant writing style of Rowling. Too often, authors kill a character early on without establishing a real connection with the reader, and consequently it leaves the reader feeling like they lost only a stranger. Fairbrother's death establishes a thread that winds throughout the novel.The town of Pagford is well depicted. I can still see it in my mind's eye. It's quaint and charming, but at the same time, cold and gray. Rowling does an excellent job developing the backdrop for the story to include how this backdrop intertwines with the plot.Her characters are so visceral. She explores the lives of not only the adults in the town, but also the teens and the very real affect they take on the lives of their parents, their teachers, the headmaster, and the counselors. She exposes the viscous cycle of the educated and the uneducated, and blows the roof off the hypocritical alliance the rich people of Pagford have for the poor they ""are trying to help.""  Her portrayal of the high school students I found to be expertly written as it captured the way I often view the students I teach everyday; and sadly this was not a good thing. I think, as a teacher, it gave me some comfort to know that across the ocean, teenagers are the same. I was beginning to think we only had true pricks in America.It is certainly true this book is not for children. There is the foulest of language and horrible, depraved depictions of sex. The context of the book really requires you to examine marriage, friendships, and acquaintances in a new way. It causes one to think about trust and how very fragile this is, and it plays to the fantasy life both men and women desire to have amidst the reality they are living in. This book is not for the faint of heart.The Casual Vacancy is a literary read. It is not fast paced nor action packed, but it is deep. I found there was a lull mid-way for me, but as I pressed on I understood the intentionality of this choice by the author. Real life is not always in fast-forward, and this book is a snapshot of real people, of real life.In the end, I would give this book 5 out of 5 stars, a rating I rarely establish upon any book. I know I will continue to think about the lessons and depth of emotion created by Rowling in this novel for years to come. That, my friends, is the mark of a good book.",5,"11 12, 2012",1352678400,"[0, 0]"

Most may not understand some of the slang used (especially by the more 'lower-class' characters) unless you understand British slang and culture very well.  If you have seen the TV series Skins, then I imagined it to be similar, only there is a lot more adult character attention and politics.Without spoiling too much, the main topics in the book are politics, drug addiction, death, teenage frolics, sex, and plenty of language to suit them.  At first I thought Rowling was over-using bad language to set this book far apart from Harry Potter, but in the end I decided the use of harsh or shocking language was to appropriate to emphasize the characters personalities.  Without it, you may mis-judge them.Rowling's writing is still very good.  Despite the main plot subject matter, she was still able to keep my attention with her great similes and metaphors, that often elicit a chuckle or two.  The humor is not overbearing, and woven in, leaning more toward dark comedy.  Be ready to meet a lot of characters within the first chapters.  It was a little confusing at first, and by the end I still got a couple mixed up, but I was able to figure out who was who.  The book is steady, and you may have a hard time connecting with the characters at first.  As events start to unfold, you should begin to like them for who they are.  I don't agree with some reviews that I read that said they were completely hollow or unlikeable.Eventually, the story builds up to a climactic and shockingly sad ending, which I thought was very Skins-esque in that it is very hard hitting, dramatic, and sombre, but also very real.",4,"10 10, 2012",1349827200,"[4, 4]"

Rowling is one of the most successful writers of all time due to her Harry Potter franchise becoming a worldwide phenomenon. I was a bit surprised when she announced that she was writing an adult book instead of another children fantasy series. The moment she made the announcement the pressure for success was on her.Every fan, every reader, and every critic are expecting another Harry Potter, but in reality what we get is a small town drama with a bit of dark humor mixed in. The book is getting mixed to negative reviews from critics and fans because of the sudden change in genre. J. K. Rowling warned everyone that she was writing a different kind of book.Why is everyone so disappointed?Let me tell you the plot of The Casual Vacancy.The book opens on a Sunday evening in the small English town of Pagford where Barry Fairbrother drops dead! His wife, kids, and friends are mourning his death, but not everybody cared for him. You see Barry was on the town council and now because of his death there is a casual vacancy. In other words, his spot on the council is open and there are citizens that would die to fill it. In Barry's control, prior to his death, was the rough part of town known as ""The Fields"" and the lease to the local drug clinic, which are both now up for grabs. The three men interested in the seat are Cubby Wall (Barry's friend and deputy headmaster of the school) Simon Price (He's a hateful man, especially toward his teenage son, Andrew), and Miles Mollison.After reading several reviews, I saw that readers were comparing this book to the Harry Potter series, which is completely unfair in my opinion. You can't compare a children's book to an adult book. It's like comparing Judy Blume's Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing to her adult book Wifey. The two books have nothing in common except for the fact that they are written by the same author. I started reading The Causal Vacancy as is, keeping Harry Potter far from my mind.How did I like it?That's a tough question, because it took me forever to finish reading it. J.K. Rowing is one of the greatest authors of our generation. She is a skillful writer. I would even compare her writing style to Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. The Causal Vacancy is filled unlikable and flawed characters. The only character that I even liked was the teenager Krystal Weedon, who is a drug user, swears like a sailor, and will throw a punch at anyone that ticks her off. Her mother is pathetic excuse for a human being as she is heavy into drugs and is neglecting Krystal and her little brother, Robbie.The Causal Vacancy is a dark twisted satire of our society and how people will do anything to get what they want.Will there be a sequel?Considering the negative reviews, I highly doubt it, but the ending leaves it opens for future installments.After reading the book I'm left with a sour taste in my mouth. Yes, it is beautifully written, but it is quite boring with way too many characters, actually there is not even a main character which is part of the book's problem. I respect the author decision to write something completely different than anyone would expect. The Casual Vacancy will never be considered a classic and it will probably never be adapted to film or television. The book is not for everyone. Your have to read it with an open mind. In the end, I neither liked nor hated the book.",3,"10 13, 2012",1350086400,"[1, 1]"

"0316228532","A36S5U0QOWMOSX","Collin Garbarino","Not Very Good","I expected that Rowling's latest book would contain some wit and humor. These magical characteristics must only belong in the young adult genre. Rowling has written us an ""adult"" book, which I suppose is coded language for ""boring."" I did, however, find it ironic that an ""adult"" book could be so juvenile.The characters are clich&eacute;d, and The Casual Vacancy is so laced with profanity that it's almost laughable. Rowling comes across like a middle school child who has just discovered that he can ""cuss"" with friends and get away with it. She uses her newfound vocabulary to the point of absurdity. The ubiquitous sex and vulgarity make the book awkward and clumsy.The biggest problem with the book, however, is its cast of characters. I admit that a few characters are interesting, but as I said most of citizens of Pagford are clich&eacute;s. None of the characters, however, are likeable. From page 1 to page 503, I genuinely didn't care about one person in the book. The only person that I thought might potentially be likeable was the councilman whom Rowling killed off on the second page. At times I realized that Rowling wanted me to view certain characters sympathetically, but she never managed to convince me.Though I believe the lack of a sympathetic character to be the unforgiveable sin in a novel, Rowling compounds her transgressions by offering a fairly boring plot. Not only did I not care about the characters in the book, but also their deeds were tedious and unrelated. The book claims to be about the election to fill the dead councilman's seat, and a number of pages deal with that theme. But really, the whole election could have been left out of the book and not much would have changed. The political maneuverings that attended the election spark a few interesting events, but alas, these events go nowhere.All these wasted pages left me with one simple question: ""What was Rowling's editor at Little Brown thinking?"" And then I realized. The editor at Little Brown must have known that this was a train wreck of a book. Any editor worth his or her salt could see that this book was at least 200 pages too long. Any editor could see the problems with character and plot. But it didn't matter because this was J. K. Rowling. The Casual Vacancy would sell amazingly well no matter how bad it was. No editor would dare suggest improvements to the book, because no editor would risk her taking the project somewhere else.",2,"10 26, 2012",1351209600,"[2, 4]"

First off, you need to set aside Harry Potter and read this book as if it were the only work of hers you've ever read.  If you go into this expecting Hogwarts and all the gang reinvented, you will be disappointed. You'll love or hate this book on the strength of her work, not because it is part of a mega-phenomenon. It is a story of ordinary people, living rather mundane lives. Their politics are mundane and too important to them; their motives are the usual trifling things which motivate petty people. These are not always nice people.  That said, I would recommend this book to those who read literary fiction. This is an adult book, for adult readers.Councilman Barry Fairbane dies young and unexpectedly. This leaves a vacancy on the town council and throws the little town of Pagford in shock.Pagford is, on the surface, a postcard English village, with a cobbled market square and an old abbey, but with a poorer, more modern housing development scarring the outskirts. Beneath the surface, the citizens cope with poverty, drug abuse, child abuse, rape, and mental illness along with all the social illnesses which lie hidden under the mask of civility in most communities. Rowling explores this underbelly with sharp wit, sarcastic humor and sly social commentary.The empty seat left by Barry on the town's council soon becomes the focus of an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations. The characters are well drawn and in true Rowling style, you see them fully before you, warts and all.  They curse, they commit terrible crimes and they are violent toward each other in ways that are both heinous and reprehensible. The youth curse, commit crimes and everything else real youth regrettably do. There are raw, violent scenes  depicted in this tale, and each scene is believable and drew me in.The reason I can only give this book four out of five stars is there are some places where it is a bit slow; but I stuck with it through those few places and I'm glad I did.Over all this is a good effort, and shows Rowling's understanding of human nature. HOWEVER - I was unimpressed with the price of the e-book download, and feel that for most people it would be a better investment to wait and buy the book as a paperback when it comes out, because it is most definitely overpriced.",4,"09 29, 2012",1348876800,"[12, 17]"

It isn't even a book Harry Potter might want to read.  There is no positive correlation between enjoying HP and liking this book.  If anything, people who liked the HP series might be somewhat less likely to enjoy this book.  But that doesn't keep this from being an excellent book.  It is possible to love both -- I did -- but many people won't.In Casual Vacancy, Rowling takes us on a tour of the internal life of what might appear to outsiders to be the idyllic British village.  She shows us a vision of the world that many of us might prefer to ignore.  If HP showed us the optimist version of Rowling, Casual Vacancy shows us the pessimist Rowling.  Families that should be strong are actually unhappy when you get a glimpse of their inner lives.  And as Tolstoy said, each is unhappy in its own way.This could have been a depressing book to read, and there are certainly sad points in it.  But it also a book of redemption.

I think Rowling harbors a great deal of anger in her soul towards adults who are unkind, uncaring, and unfeeling towards their children.  This was evident in the Harry Potter series, but the young had recourse to magic.  In this book, the young have no recourse other than revenge by anonymous internet sabotage of the adults who have been monstrous or just plain stupid in their dealings with children and teens.

So why would I read a 500-page book penned by her?  Curiosity.  I wondered what this billionaire, mega-successful author had to say to and about adults in the real world, after spending so many years in the happy fantasyland of kiddie lit.  Well, she has a lot to say, and all of it is depressing.  A Casual Vacancy could be subtitled Dreadful People Behaving Badly in a Picturesque Town.  It's Britain under a microscope, analyzed by a dispeptic depressive.  It's misanthropy and despair.  The book is bleak.British literature has a long tradition of small-town sagas, where class divisions and petty resentments create drama amidst timbered heritage buildings, manor houses, and cobbled streets.  It's the Biscuit-Box version of rural and small-town England.  Throw in a couple of cops and a dead body, or a clammy vicar with a secret past, and you have a BBC drama.  Rowling has used this familiar template -- turned it on its head -- to display the raw ugliness of real life in modern Britain.  Blatant and enduring racism, class snobberies, the shortcomings of social services and the failure of the welfare state, the pettiness of politics, the overwhelming hypocrisy of humans across all classes -- it's all there in the little town of Pagford.  It's not for nothing that Rowling has the addict Terri keeping her kit for shooting up in a biscuit tin sporting a scene from Merrie Olde England (a rather heavy-handed writer's trick for such an experienced author).For all its wordiness, this is a quick read.  I found myself skimming some of the harsher passages (did we have to hear so much from Simon?), and regretting that I'd read the more sordid bits (pure pulp fiction, that).  But I did feel compelled to finish, and I will tell you why.  The simmering nastiness that runs through this book was very familiar to me.  It reminded me of my own small community, all the way down to the smug, self-appointed rulers, the hissing gossip, and (sadly) the ""community"" page on the Internet.  Alas.Rowling has some annoying writer's quirks, including the three-dot trail off...and the too-frequent, parenthetical aside written in the pluperfect.  For that alone I'm inclined to give this just one star.  But she is an astute observer of human behavior (if a stink-eyed one), so A Casual Vacancy gets moved up to ""it's okay.""  Not awful, not great, but certainly depressing.",2,"09 14, 2013",1379116800,"[1, 2]"
"0316228532","A33TU21N460QIS","Crystal @ I Totally Paused! ""Crystal @ I Tota...","A lovely piece of literature from a well known author","Like many other readers, I was delighted to hear awhile back that JK Rowling had an adult novel for us...adult like it was written for adults, not that it was going to be some erotic romance or anything like that.  I preordered a copy the day it became available, and lamented the fact that I couldn't pick it up as soon as it arrived, since I was traveling overseas at the time.  Meanwhile, as reviews started popping up around the internet, I was disappointed to read that people seem to have quite mixed opinions about this novel.After reading the entire thing, I can see why people have these mixed feelings.  This novel is nothing like Harry Potter in the story elements, the chief among them being that this is set in the actual world without any magic, no true heroes or villains, and no one overwhelmingly charming or likeable.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that the only character in this novel who isn't mildly repulsive in some way is our deceased gentleman, Barry.With all that in mind, if you only liked the Harry Potter series because of the magic and all that, this novel won't be your kind of thing.  Rowling breaks any mold we may have put her in, shows us that she's not afraid to tackle evil in the real world, and really demonstrates what a remarkable writer she is.  If nothing else, it took me at least four or five HP books before I shed some tears, but this one had me going by the end.Rather than telling us a story about good versus evil, this novel is about life.  Regardless of where you're from, you can probably recognize something of your life in one or more of the characters, whether that's the unhappy/happy marriage, the singledom with or without a child, neglect and abuse, going beyond expectations to break the stereotype of your life, or just being an average teenager.  The teens in this novel aren't without their flaws either: they are cruel, confused, destructive, and trying to find their way to adulthood.  Oh, and most of them hate their parents.  Shocker!I feel like I can't review this without at least mentioning to y'all that there are some difficult situations, and if you've got triggers for things you can't read, this might hit them.  There's abuse, both emotional and physical.  A lot of talk about drug use and what it's like for an addict trying hard to stay clean.  There are many instances of bullying and the self-injury that can result from that.  This book really does not pull any punches when it comes to these hard truths of life, and shows us what can lie behind closed doors inside any of our communities.  But if these situations are hard for you to read, I would say be warned that they exist.In some ways, this was an exhausting read, but I mean that in the best way.  I'm glad I read it, and I'm happy to have it on my shelf, yet I won't be picking it up again for awhile.  What I can say is that I'm very excited to see what Rowling comes up with next, and that people who enjoy good writing or character studies will enjoy this one.",4,"11 23, 2012",1353628800,"[4, 4]"
"0316228532","AQCQ5F0OJXMG9","Crystal Starr Light","""But who could bear to know which stars were already dead?""","""But who could bear to know which stars were already dead...could anybody stand to know that they all were?""One day, in the small English town of Pagford, Barry Fairweather dies. This leaves a ""casual vacancy"" in the Town Council and, more importantly, has a drastic impact in several of the townsfolks' lives.It's probably a rare person who has not heard of J.K. Rowling, the woman who created the boy who lived. I'm familiar with some of her Harry Potter books (the first three); I rather enjoyed them. When I heard about this book, I was intrigued, but to be honest, the cover blurb just didn't sound interesting. I am not a big fan of ""contemporary"" novels. The biggest reason I did end up reading this was for my book club. And while there were moments when I thought this book and I weren't going to get along, overall, I was very impressed.But before I get too far, I want to spend a few moments making a few points clear:1) This is absolutely, positively NOT Harry Potter for Adults.2) This book is NOT for children, despite having teenagers starring some pretty major roles. (Maybe OK for mature teens)3) This is not a ""fun"" book, filled with magic, adventure and a happily ever after.If you come into this book expecting to read the adult adventures of Harry Potter, filled with magic and adventure, you will most likely leave disappointed (or abandon ship at page 100). For once, the cover blurb does not lie; for fans of Harry Potter and Rowling, I really, really recommend reading that blurb well before diving in.With that out of the way...When I started this novel, I almost got lost. There is an ENORMOUS cast of characters that are slowly introduced. We see their point of view; we watch them go through the day; we see who they interact with and how. The first 150 pages in particular were the slowest, as Rowling is slowly building her cast.But once that cast is constructed--WOW, what an amazing book! Things really start to flow, the book takes shape, and I flew through pages. This book is highly readable, filled with a varied cast of characters and is incredibly well-plotted.My favorite characters were probably Krystal Weedon, Tessa Walls, and Andrew Price--though there were plenty of others (Kay, Gaia, Samantha, Sukhvinder) that were stand-outs. My least favorites were Simon Price (what an @$$!), Howard Mollison (what a creep!), and Stuart Walls (what a brat!). But the thing that both my favorites and least favorites have in common is this: they are ALL well-drawn characters, fully-fleshed, interesting, realistic. Rowling knows how to create characters, ones you love to bits and ones you want to chase with a rake. Lord knows how hard it is to create ONE good character in a novel, but so many? It's impressive.I was impressed with the setting; I've read a lot of books set in different places but haven't really felt as if it were anything extraordinary, almost like those generic towns in old Hollywood movies. Here, the town of Pagford and the Fields almost become characters of their own. They have depth, they feel different and unique.And finally, the story. This is one that is very deeply character-driven, but it takes a while to build. During that time, it can be slow and laborious. But once all the characters are established, Rowling lets them loose to their final confrontation--one that gripped me by the heart and made me want to weep. It was beautifully circular, it was well-written, it was poignant.I am not going to go so far and say this is the best book in the world. I'm sure that if Rowling hadn't wrote this, it would be quietly sitting on a shelf in the bookstore collecting dust and not sending the hype generator into overtime. But that's also not to say that this is a terrible book. I rather enjoyed myself reading this and can't believe how relatively quickly I went through 500 pages.If you are considering reading Rowling's adult venture, I want to make this perfectly clear: this is NOT Harry Potter. Do NOT come into this expecting that same type of story. I also do not recommend this for any but the most mature of teens as there is quite a bit of language, sex, rape, drug abuse, and violence. However, if you come into it realizing what it is and what it isn't, I think you'll enjoy it.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",4,"10 24, 2012",1351036800,"[1, 1]"

I did not give it five stars because it plods along to a fairly expected end with hardly any real surprises or plot twists. It doesn't compare with the Roger Galbraith crime novel.

She had no purpose in using this type of material other than to make it an Adult book.  The language is unneeded for the story and the story seems to have no real plot.  It is total garbage as far as I am concerned.  I do believe that teens might like it just for the tittillating passages, but adults should be offended by the way the material is presented.  When necessary to make a point, then I don't mind graphic language, but her usage is only for shock value, I believe.  It seems she believes that it is needed to make it an Adult book.

"0316228532","A1L98BQKBVODDP","Currer Bell ""Currer Bell""","We're not in Hogwarts anymore, so if you're looking for fantasy, look elsewhere","Though at times overwrought, this is a skillful and moving novel which leaves the black and white morality of Harry Potter's universe far behind.The Casual Vacancy is a carefully and intricately plotted tragicomedy which takes place in the microcosm of a seemingly idyllic village called Pagford.  This world is gritty and brutally authentic, peopled with an interconnected web of very real characters.  The story revolves around an estate (government funded housing) called the Fields which is technically part of Pagford, though many Pagford residents consider it a blight on their storybook community.  The novel opens with the death of Barry Fairbrother, the man who leaves the titular vacancy on the Pagford council.  A local election ensues.  This would seem like an unimportant affair and dull basis for a novel, but Rowling illustrates the far-reaching effects such minor local politics can have.  There are no punches pulled in the grim finale.Others have complained that the characters are unlikeable and have no redeeming qualities.  I find that ridiculous.  To me the characters are refreshing, because in them Rowling explores truths we're often afraid to admit to ourselves.  On some level, I sympathized with every one of them.This is a book that takes place in the REAL world and concerns REAL people who are more multifaceted than the simpler heroes and villains of Rowling's earlier work.  I enjoyed Harry Potter, and I loved those characters, but they lived in a black and white world designed for children.

Depending on the kind of life you've led and the people you've known, you may or may not find the characters to be &#34;real&#34; in that they seem to have more than their fair share of faults, idiosyncrasies, and secrets, but I found them to be very real on many levels. If you don't find them to be real or believable, just remember it's a novel, not a psychology text book.Nothing about this book is remotely related to the Harry Potter series, so you should approach this book as if it were written by someone you never heard of.

I love urban fantasy and paranormal romance and young adult books, but Harry Potter never appealed to me. Rowling has received so much ridicule for this book because it wasn't another Potter-like story, but I applaud her for stepping outside that world and doing something incredibly different. So many of my writer friends love to write and read in different genres. I love to write and read in different genres.

I grew up in a small town and I found it incredibly believable. I don't generally like books in third-person omniscient and the massive cast took a bit to get acquainted with, but the way Rowling wove the sub-plots together had me watching the clock until I could get back into their lives. There were a few scenes that were predictable, but overall I found the book to be authentic. Rowling dug into the worst of each of the characters and exposed that for the reader without leaving me feeling like she was biased in one way or another about the characters' justifications or motivations. There were circumstances and reasons why each characters was who they were. It was neither good nor bad, right nor wrong, it simply was. She showed how the ""privileged"" are just as troubled and twisted as those who are not, but did so without taking sides or glorifying or degrading one side over the other.And, above all, I loved the ending.

"0316228532","A2O2RZ1Z0AHZCB","Dan Thompson ""Avid Book Blogger and UK Author""","Not Just a One Trick Pony","After being won over by the hype of The Casual Vacancy, her first adult novel, I decided to give this a go and thankfully I was proven wrong.The Casual Vacancy is all about the lives of several families following the aftermath of Barry Fairbrother's untimely death. Barry, universally respected by most, was a member of the Pagford council and now an empty seat has emerged, the little idyllic town throws itself into the most political of wars. You could be excused for thinking that this doesn't sound the least bit interesting as storylines go and to be honest it isn't, but what this book is really about is the characters and their actions.I've got to say that, despite including major minority groups into the novel, Rowling actually creates a real living example of British society today. As I was reading, I saw familiar people; people I could easily recognise living in my own town. Many critics have accused Rowling of creating characters that are wooden and two dimensional, but I completely disagree. I mean, of course I'm not aware of where people live, but I think if you live in a large city, you miss out on all of the nuances of what a small community feels like and what people are willing to do, just for information or gossip.Rowling sets a beautiful scene with Pagford and then adds a more severe backdrop with the `fields'; a run down area of council housing, drug addicts and prostitutes, that some residents don't want it to be associated with their heavenly Pagford, and instead start a campaign to have it removed from their border into the neighbouring town of Yarvil. Of course, wonderful Barry Fairbrother was against this idea and so the loved ones left behind after his death, feel the need to rally and make a stand against Howard Mollison and his motley crew.But as I've already said, the gem of a book here really lies within the personal lives of Pagford's residents. It really does ring true that from an outside perspective, families seems perfect and happy, but once you delve into the small cracks left open you begin to form a picture that includes unhappiness, class, snobbery, drugs, youth, self harm and even rape. It's interesting to see that the young people of Pagford start to formulate their own personal war over their parents and actually cause quite a stir amongst the democratic election of poor Barry Fairbrother's vacant seat.She's really hit the nail on the head with the characterisation and adapted her narrative depending on whom that particular section is about. Shirley Mollison is a snob, someone who backs up her husband without question and is always on the look out for juicy gossip. Samantha Mollison is unhappy in her marriage and starts to fall for `Jake', a member of her daughter's favourite boyband - he is sixteen. Krystal Weedon is a resident of the Fields and daughter to drug addict Terri. Kyrstal actually forms quite a big chunk of the story with her brash, aggressive attitude and loose morals.Another area the critics didn't seem to like was the ending; I actually thought the finale was just right. It left it where it needed to be left. It could so have easily run on, but like a true writer, Rowling knew where to end it. I can't give anything away as that would be unfair, but I didn't see it coming. I should have done; I've guessed endings much more clich&eacute;d than this, but I think the result of this is that I was so engrossed in the book that I wasn't actually trying to guess anything. It came naturally to me and I enjoyed it more because of it.The book isn't perfect however. I thought the layout mostly needed reinventing. It is split into seven parts, which is fine, but at the beginning it formulated a concept of a different day of the week as the heading and then what happened on that day. I felt this could have worked wonderfully throughout rather than scrapping it after the first part and ultimately it sometimes became hard to realise how much time had passed since reading different parts, or even chapters for that matter.You don't have to like a character for you to understand why the author decided to take their journey down a certain path. If you understand it then that's just part of the journey of reading itself. However, I have to say that one particular `path' regarding Gavin Hughes, a lawyer in Pagford, was pathetic! I was totally smacked in the face when I discovered, towards the end, what was going on with him. And not in a good way too. The storyline here for him was ridiculous, completely unnecessary and actually a little annoying. It was as if Rowling couldn't find a way to end things for him in the book so she took a wild grab in the air and pulled this idea straight from an episode of a soap.I do have to say however, that actually JK Rowling has won me over; for her adult novels that is. It is full of character, exceptional use of authentic voice and completely engrossing. I had my particular favourite characters and a few who got on my nerves; but that's real life, isn't it? This is adult fiction that is unlike anything other I have read before and I'm happy I gave it a go. It is so realistic how she managed to divide people here not only in class, but also political views, location, age and religion. I happily take my hat off to Rowling and admit, I was wrong.",4,"09 7, 2013",1378512000,"[1, 2]"

Appling ""polkovnik""","Bleak, sad, tragic, but never banal.","Rowling's venture into the adult (very adult) novel is good, but no Harry Potter in any way.Her writing is of course superb. Her editor, however, could have been more ruthless regarding early longueurs and overall length. Kudos, however, for getting that ""casual vacancy"" established early and quickly; also for the occasional flashes of Rowlingian whimsy despite the somber plot.I won't synopsize that plot here (see preceding reviews). Like Metalious's ""Peyton Place"" of the fifties, it packs most of the iniquities of humankind into one very small village. None of the ""seven deadly sins"" is left uncommitted here, and few are regretted.  There are a few unlikely happenings, but they do support the developing plot and tragedy; just take 'em with a grain of salt. The characters are generally very well drawn, the women and girls more so than the men and boys.I don't agree with those who consider all the characters except the late Barry irredeemable. Some indeed are. Others, like one (not both!) of the teenage boys, suffer mainly from home life problems and just from being sixteen. A bullied teen turns from depressed and troubled loser into courageous heroine. The tragic character around whom the action revolves is too complex to describe without spoilers, but she might well have triumphed over every obstacle had not Councilman Fairbrother died untimely.**** minus. Pagford is certainly no Hogsmeade, but this is a compelling read whose characters and events will stay with you.DaveP.S. I had no problems with the Kindle version, except for the price. Surely Amazon must have more leverage than that!!Edited to add the following:In surfing through other reviews, I've noticed that some reviewers feel somehow betrayed because this is so gritty a book, featuring so many unlikeable and unsavory characters and unpleasant events. To them, JKR has lost her animated portrait in Dumbledore's office and fallen from grace. After all, even 4 Privet Drive is a way better place than Pagford Village.That's a very unfortunate perspective. It was always clear that ""A Casual Vacancy"" would be a new departure. And we all knew that the author's early womanhood was not easy, and had doubtless given her plenty of background on the less pristine side of life. No one had any reason to expect this adult novel to be about Harry and Ginny's halcyon days post-Voldemort.All kudos to the author for having had the guts to write this brave book.

These might be the people that will read anything that J.K. Rowling writes just because she's J.K. Rowling.I don't belong to either of these camps, but I loved the book anyway. First of all, as a general warning, this book is character-driven, not plot-driven. There are a lot of characters that are introduced, but I didn't find it hard to keep track of them. In the story, nothing really happens. The characters all just react to the death and the book describes the complexity of life while a community is coping with loss. It's a bleak book. Everything is tinted with a feeling of hopelessness and depression and most people are unhappy. Basically, Rowling wrote about life in small-town England and she made no apologies for how honest it is. There are elements of casual sex, rape, drug use, and self-harm in this book and copious amounts of swearing to go along with it. It's by no means pretty, but it's resounding in its sincerity.To sum up, if you like to read books as an escape from everyday life, this book may not be for you.

Wilkes ""Diane Wilkes, Voracious Reader""","THE CASUAL VACANCY Not A Dramatic Departure","When you've written a multi-million dollar book series that has spawned movies, merchandise up the wazoo, and miraculously magnetized boys back into the reading fold, as J.K. Rowling did with the Harry Potter books, much is expected. Loyal fans want to love the next book you write; snobby critics look forward to skewering it--""She can write children's novels, but...""THE CASUAL VACANCY, however, is not as dramatic a departure as one would think. At the soul of the HP books is a love for the underdog. The least advantaged (Harry, Dobby, the Weasleys) are the noble souls, the wealthy aristocrats (the Malfoys and their kin) petty and corrupt. Rowling's Pagford Village is as much a character as any of the people living in its privileged enclave, as is ""The Fields,"" where lives darkness and desolation on the edge of town.  Other than the recently deceased Barry Fairbrother (the name proof positive that this vacancy doesn't fall too far from the Rowling oeuvre--she loves giving characters names that fit their attributes), A CASUAL VACANCY's characters are unpleasant in ways large and small.  At best, the Pagford denizens are uncaring, and at worst, they are uncaring--and to Ms. Rowling, there is no greater sin.Rowling is an avowed admirer of Jane Austen's writing and has constructed the equivalent of a small British village for her ""little bit of ivory."" Unlike Austen, she includes a close-up view of the seamy side of life. Rowling is, to put it mildly, not the wordsmith Austen is, but she does have her gift for creating characters who are both distinctive and universal. Pagford is filled with characters we all know: dissatisfied wives who mourn their lost youth and drink too much; fat old lechers who see themselves as avuncular; single men who fear commitment and confrontation in equal doses.The plot is fairly simple. Plays for power arise when Barry Fairbrother dies, leaving an open seat on the village council. If only a true Pagfordian can get the seat (as opposed to a bleeding heart liberal), the village will finally be able to unmoor ""The Fields"" from its borders.There is not a single living character who is basically decent, though Rowling suggests that the denizens of The Fields want to be better than they are, unlike their more privileged counterparts. This presents a conundrum--if privilege spoils humanity, won't the decency of the underprivileged be altered if they are given the same opportunities?The grim scenes culminate in a climax that proves just how dangerous the lack of basic caring can be. Rowling's political philosophy is more naked in this book than in the HP series, and while it didn't stop me from reading it, I felt that nuances and characters were sacrificed in order to deliver a too-clear message. There's a thin line between fiction and propaganda and I am afraid THE CASUAL VACANCY is diminished by too much black and white and not enough subtle gray.",3,"10 1, 2012",1349049600,"[37, 46]"

I am a very political person (I am very active in county and state-wide politics). I would identify as a liberal. All that being said, I found The Casual Vacancy to be a well-written social commentary.I believe it is the duty of society to help everyone. That all people deserve an equal chance to live a successful life and that the government has a hand in making that happen.Right now in the United States, the concept of how and if we should help those who are struggling is being hotly contested in the Presidential election. Do we want to be a society where the luckiest of us succeed, oftentimes because of luck or numerous intangible benefits, and the rest are left to languish or one that aims to raise the level of all people? It is a question that J.K. Rowling so deftly handles here.Pagford, the town so beautifully created by J.K. Rowling is having this same kind of identity crisis. Many years in the past, a portion of land once owned by a famous family in town is sold and public housing is built. Those living in the housing have access to the good schools of Pagford. There are those on the council who wish for the estates to become the problem of the next largest city of Yarvil. They feel that The Fields is a blight on their perfect town.The Casual Vacancy has a slow start. It revolves around an entire town and is full of characters. The change of voice from one character to the next was somewhat confusing until I really started to get a feel for who each character was. Around the 300 page mark, The Casual Vacancy really picks up steam. We start to see how interconnected this community is and how they can and do impact each others lives. It is not only a story of social responsibility, that we owe to our neighbors to make sure that those with less are treated with dignity but also that the attention that we pay can save lives.The most tragic storyline of the Weedons is handled so well. We can see why Terri, who is abused nearly from birth, is barely able to function even if she seems to want to change. Why we get a cycle of abuse when her own negligence leads to her daughter acting out and eventually getting raped. It bucks the stereotype of the lazy person with their hand out waiting for their government check to read the story of what went so wrong in one family.The ending is really brilliant and so tragic. It is like a dance in which each character misses their turn, and one small, seemingly insignificant action has huge ramifications on the lives of the most vulnerable.The Casual Vacancy by J.K. Rowling is a social commentary where you are forced to imagine the lives of those around you. They can be raw and cruel but the authenticity is really gripping.",4,"10 17, 2012",1350432000,"[3, 4]"

Krystal Weedon and her family are a pretty strong plot line, and I think it would have been a much better book if JKR had tightened it up to just her story and reduced the story arc of other characters to more of a supporting role, and how they relate to the Weedon family. Or maybe more of Sukhvinder too, her plot and ending felt very much like that of a character like Neville Longbottom, just most entrenched in the Muggle world, obviously. But there were so many storylines that just felt like, ""well, this stuff happens in the real world."" Yes, it does, and the descriptions are probably quite accurate. But that doesn't make them particularly rewarding to read, outside the occasional recognitions of some emotional truths. The arcs aren't that satisfying, and they don't particularly reward the effort of keeping up with them.Still, I admire Jo Rowling for trying something so different. It's a fascinating thing to read if only to see that an author who outsold the Bible and became a billionaire off writing doesn't necessarily strike gold every time. If you're really interested in the themes of Harry Potter -- death and the power of love and kindness, recognizing common humanity while not being blind to the ugly things people can do to one another -- then it's interesting to read some of these same principles finding expression in a very different setting and cast of characters.

Second, if you bought this expecting Harry Potter that was your mistake not the author's. This book is clearly advertised as an adult fiction book.

It's not just about washing hands I learned, and JK says she suffered from it whenshe was younger. There's also a methadone clinic that plays a central role and a sobering look at a physically abusive father.  I have to confess that I savoured every scene featuring the outsized first citizen of Pagford, Howard Mollison.  He's one of the funniest pompous characters since Ignatius in A Confederacy of Dunces.  The teenage characters are wonderfully drawn, especially in the way they communicate to each other.  Krystal of the Fields is the female Harry Potter without the magic powers.  She strives as hard as Harry, and takes to crew like he does to Quidditch.

Her writing skills are superior, her characters seem real (faults and all), and the plot is very well-developed, if disturbing (realistically so) at times. I highly recommend this novel to readers who enjoy quality literary fiction.",5,"12 29, 2012",1356739200,"[0, 1]"
"0316228532","A3XLGH2AK6H02","Donna ""Happy Booker""","Secrets, Sabotage, and Scandal or Oh the things muggles get up to...","Casual Vacancy tells the story of a small community in the aftermath of the unexpected death of one of its community leaders and council members, Barry Fairbrother. Several of Fairbrother's peers are ready and willing to fill his empty council seat but not everyone is happy with the nominees. Suddenly this small town is like an episode of Gossip Girl as somebody claiming to be Barry Fairbrother's ghost begins posting on the council's website and outing all of the member's dirty little secrets (XoXo) And while all of the adults are plotting, planning, and pointing fingers, who is watching their kids? These parents may have underestimated their teens' resentments as they focus all of their energy on their position in the community.I listened to the Audible audio version of this and the narration was brilliant. He didn't really change his voice for the characters much, he simply told the story but his voice and tone was so pleasant that I was able to lose myself completely in the story. I would absolutely recommend listening to this on audio.What's great about Casual Vacancy is the authenticity of the characters and the way Rowling so insightfully exposes the uglier side of human nature, the fears and insecurities that sometimes motivate people to do the things they do. While Casual Vacancy is about an empty council seat, the real meat and potatoes of the story is in the interactions between these characters and the complexities of those relationships. Of all the many personalities in this story, I thought that the teenagers were written exceptionally well, not surprisingly. And although the plot revolves around the empty council seat, the children definitely play a big role in this story.There were a lot of characters with a lot of interaction between all of them which sometimes made it difficult for me to remember who was married to who and which kid belonged to which parent but I can see that cutting even one of the many personalities would have taken something significant away from the story. The only negative about the charcaters being so genuine and familiar is that it felt a bit like spying on your neighbors. It's all deliciously scandalous what they get up to, but only if you know them personally. Otherwise, no one really cares because they're just like everyone else's' neighbors.Where Casual Vacancy didn't work for me was in the plot. It's almost as if she created these complex, multi-faceted characters and then threw together these unexceptional circumstances so they could interact. For most of the book, I was honestly pretty bored with the storyline. But about 2/3s of the way through, I began to really enjoy the story. Just getting there as a bit slow. The complex characters and wonderful writing might be enough to pull a reader through a plot that is like slogging through quicksand. The question is, was the payoff at the end enough to make that tedious journey worth it. Ultimately, for me it was.It's JK Rowling so it is no surprise that the writing was stellar. At one point, when I complained about how slow moving the story was, a friend asked me if I would have even kept reading if it would have been any other author. My reply was, if it had been any other author, I would have never picked this book up. I had to keep this fact in mind when listening to Casual Vacancy because I thought maybe that is why many people are having such an issue with this book. A book like this might not appeal to many of Rowling's fan base being so far from what they enjoyed about the Harry Potter series.There were several laugh out loud moments and I especially enjoyed some of the eccentricities of the characters. The pacing of the story was slow and steady, with emphasis on the ""slow"". I did like that Casual Vacancy wrapped up all the loose ends by the end even though some of those loose ends seemed like they were tied up a little too conveniently to feel genuine. Overall, it was a lot darker than I expected which certainly increased my enjoyment of it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for fans of Harry Potter, but perhaps for fans of General fiction.",4,"10 3, 2012",1349222400,"[6, 11]"

"0316228532","A2JBAIXVIO0OR3","dpappas","Keep An Open Mind","This is a book that I really tried to start without any preconceived notions. I banned myself from reading any reviews of this book or any comments about it from other readers (the only thing I allowed myself to read was the book's summary). Basically what I tried to do was forget that J.K. Rowling was the author and to completely separate this book from the Harry Potter series.This book follows the lives of the citizens of a little town called Pagford. It shows how the people of Pagford move on after the death of Barry Fairbrother, a councillor of the parish council. The parish council had been teeming with drama over a lower-income area of Pagford called The Fields and the local drug rehab center, Bellchapel, and it only gets worse after Barry's death.When I first started reading this book I got a bit confused with who all the characters were. There are quite a few characters and the book changes point of view a lot so it does take some time to familiarize yourself with all the characters and how they relate with one another. J.K. Rowling was great with developing and fleshing out the characters throughout the book.The main theme that I really got out of this book was the struggle between the rich and the poor. The selfish and ignorant ""rich"" people of Pagford no longer want The Fields to be included in their town. Meanwhile the ""poor"" and hopeless people of The Fields are just looking to survive. What J.K. Rowling achieves brilliantly is her unveiling of the two groups to show just how similar they are. Both the rich of Pagford and the poor of The Fields have their own problems and their own battle scars. Neither is better or more perfect than the other.Unlike J.K. Rowling's previous books (which I swore to myself I wasn't going to mention) this book doesn't really have a happy ending, at least not for everyone. More tragedy is brought upon the town of Pagford and readers really get to see what certain characters are made of. While I enjoyed the ending it did feel a bit rushed and unresolved to me. It was a beautiful ending but I was still left with some questions.This would have been a book that I would have read whether or not J.K. Rowling was the author. I can see why people would be upset or disappointed in this book, especially if they didn't start reading it with an open mind. I enjoyed this book and would be willing to recommend it to others. I would recommend this book to someone who can look past the Harry Potter series and just judge the book on its own merits. Be warned though that this book has some highly adult subjects and children should probably not be reading this.",4,"10 1, 2012",1349049600,"[8, 14]"
"0316228532","A2HN09XAGLMPIK","Draaks","SNOOZEFEST","As a fan of J.K. Rowling I was excited for her first adult novel. Was I expecting Harry Potter......no, but I was expecting a good read. Boy was I wrong. Rowling herself describes this book as a Black Comedy but there is one thing missing, there is not one thing funny in this book or even slightly amusing. With great anticipation the book finally arrived in the mail and I opened it ready for an evening of good reading. It has been a week now and I have only managed to get to page 56 and am calling it quits. In all fairness I did pick out random pages throughout the book and read them only to find out that it felt like what I had read in the first 56 pages. The characters, like the book itself, are flat and uninteresting, the cussing and the sex seems like she is trying to say See I can write for adults, except you don't have to be vulgar and crass to make a book good. Maybe if Barry Fairbrother had lived the book would have been better. Rowling also said that she didn't write the book for her fans but more for herself....maybe she should have had bound just one and kept it on her bookshelf and saved us all from wasting our money. If she writes another book will I buy it? Maybe after I have read more reviews and not just because she wrote it expecting it to be great. If I could ask her one question it would be will you please refund me my money so that I can buy a good book.

"0316228532","AMC6U7FJH9Y9X","Dragana Djordjevic-Laky","The casual Rowling Reader: Not half bad","Just because everything has been said about a book doesn't mean more can't be said, right? The first I'd say (though certainly not the first to say it), looking at the number of reviews it has prompted in record time, is that if it weren't for this author, there wouldn't be that many. But neither would there be this well-rounded, engaging, fine story. So the standard for me was: Would there have been just ""fine"" shrugs, or more, with another, less-famous writer? Was J.K. Rowling under a particular obligation to write a better-than-fine book? If you've read even one of her--here goes, I can't not mention it--Harry Potter books, you've already pre-formed an opinion. I've only read the first, and I thought this was better.Better, but not fantastic, and certainly not fantastical: J.K. Rowling picked subject matters that scream ""adult material,"" insofar I'm with the critics. With her single-mindedness, I suspect she could have written in any number of genres. Instead she did some homework and hinged her big-people- book on small-town politics and socio-economic disaster. She spins more interesting stories than the premise might suggest, and gives the plethora of characters its due, in that each and every one is treated with distinction, all connections compute and mostly convince. Nothing to sneeze at in itself.A personal peeve: The mimicked speech patterns of Krystal Weedon, the character more tragic than deceased council Barry Fairweather who caused the titled Casual Vacancy, grated after a short while, and she gets lots of coverage. Prolonged use of vernacular has caused me to set aside greater books than this one, where Krystal and her folk talk only in ""yeh,"" ""shurrup,"" and ""f@%&in;'""s, every third word or so. I get it: She's underclass. It's described minutely in non-dialogue detail, not all of which I'm sure I needed.But WHY NOT? Because it's unpleasant? It's gross? The people are repelling and so far down that we don't feel like analyzing to what measure it's by choice or circumstance. If one of the characters close to Krystal had been more appetizing, he might have met a better fate; another, upperclass character admits so much. So WHY NOT show it? Sure, it's a bit much for basically saying that beneath a picturesque surface, there often lays ugliness. Is someone like J.K. Rowling remotely authenticated (a point of pondering for another character) to write about abjection?Any good writer can write about anything. There are other, private tragedies that, compared to Krystal's, seem like luxury problems, yet they move every bit as much, if not more, for their accessibility. The account of the bullying of a girl is delicately brutal, and a matron's obsession with a boy-band while yearning for lost love, looks and youth makes us laugh and cry with, not at, her. The author knows when to apply lighter touches, and how to sustain a scene, though--my advice, Ms. Rowling, which you must be waiting for: Sex scenes are not your forte.",4,"10 16, 2012",1350345600,"[3, 4]"

"0316228532","A1W8Q1YIIGNPWU","Dranea79","I wish we didn't have to enter in a star rating","If I had to go off my own enjoyment factor, I would rate it a one. If I am rating it based on the writing, I give it three stars. But seeing as I think I should write the review based on both, so I will give the star rating based on writing and my one star review in here.  :)  Seeing as there are numerous reviews already, I won't go into a synopsis of the book as I do in so many of my other reviews - so I'll just get to the meat of everything.This book, to me, seemed like a Jerry Springer show taped over an entire town.  It showed the darker side of everyone, and the corruption that lies hidden behind this small town. I had a very hard time even getting involved in the world.  I understand her need to set up all the characters from the beginning so as we got into the story, we would know who everyone was and where they all stood. But I did have an issue with keeping up with just how many characters there were.  I almost felt the need to pull up a spreadsheet and write things out. (I almost did... But figured that would take me out of the story too much.)And like this Jerry Springer show (I'm running with a theme here. LOL) it seemed that some of the stuff was scripted WAY over the top just for ratings.  Some of the scenes could have been cut and not hurt the storyline whatsoever and kept the plot moving along.  I don't mind reading long books.  For me, the longer the better when I have time (especially from JKR), but I do have a problem with reading a long book that has scenes in it that seem to be there for shock reasons alone.  The first one occurred fairly early in the book and literally made my stomach churn.  When she talks about a child's private parts and what it did to another child seeing it - I seriously wanted to vomit. It wasn't pertinent to the story at all, and like I said, screamed ""JERRY! JERRY!"" to me. Just extra stuff that could be thrown in to shock the readers.Was her writing descriptive, yes.  Did the characters ever really seem to come into their own?  Did they seem to really grow as people and have a reason for being in the books.  Well, yes and no.  The characters seemed very flat to me - some overly stereotypical.  Some of them seemed to at least have the courtesy to think upon their poor actions and show a bit of remorse, but it didn't seem to be the case throughout the book.  I know that not all of them would either because of this real-life setting she was providing, not everyone will be able to overcome their own ignorance to see what is happening around them, and make a change for the better.  That is real life.So while this story wasn't for me, I'm sure there are a lot of people who may like this darker view on life.  This pessimistic (and sometimes revealing and shocking) take on small-town living. There was humor scattered throughout the book, which I had expected from her, but I longed for characters that I could relate with on some level, and maybe in a darker time in my life, I could have.  But more than anything it reminded me of why I refused to watch the Jerry Springer show after a while.  It's too depressing to see how humanity is innately crooked, self-serving, and in some aspect, just evil and vindictive. I read for escape,even in the adult novels I read: however, this one left me pondering if I really wanted to consider myself part of the human race any longer.  The people just seem to cruel if this is typical of how people out there think and shows their true motivations for their actions.Will I read anything else that comes from JKR?  Most definitely.  She has a gift for storytelling, and just because I don't love everything she will ever put out, doesn't mean I condemn her for the book, nor will I swear off her writing.  I will judge each book as it comes out based on its own merit. And again, this book wasn't for me, but there will be some that embrace it fully and love it.And just as a side note... I have seen many people judging the book on its price.  Last time I checked, we live in a place where people can sell their wares for whatever price they choose.  If we deem it worthy enough to pay their price, then it is ours.  If we say, ""that is WAY too much for me for that item,"" we don't buy it. If it doesn't sell well for the price being asked, then generally, economics dictate that if you want to sell your product, you lower the price. Seeing as this book hit number one the instant it went on sale... WELL... to me it shows people are willing to pay for her work.  It's like a painting.  Some people look at an abstract work of art and think, ""I wouldn't pay $5 for that!"" while others are screaming out price tags in the thousands. Value is all in the eye of the beholder. If you want it and can't afford it, you save up.  If you can afford it and you just think the tag is too high, you don't buy it.  You don't scream at the creators.  To them - this is what it is worth right now.  Maybe it won't be like that later on, but it is for now.  Yes, I know eBooks take no other cost to produce than the original formatting, cover, yadda yadda yadda, but hey, if you made a pretty shiny bracelet that took you $1 to make, but people were offing you $20 a pop for each one - tell me you would say no. On a response here, sure you would or could say no, but like many of the characters in JKR's book, you would take that money and run.  After all, it was YOUR hard work, and you should be able to reap whatever profit you could from your work. Just my own two cents.  :)",3,"09 30, 2012",1348963200,"[78, 94]"

She tells with heartbreaking honesty about the lives of both adults and teenagers in a small English town (that could just as easily be in America).

"0316228532","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","D. Williams ""Donna Williams""","Rowling can do SO much better than this","THE CASUAL VACANCY, Rowling's first novel for an adult audience, takes place in an English village called Pagford.  A member of the parish council, Barry Fairbrother, has died suddenly of a brain aneurism, leaving the casual vacancy - the British term for the need to fill a vacated seat on the parish council.Pagford seems like the perfect little English village, but it is far from it.  With politics being politics anywhere, readers see the people of the parish council quarreling among themselves, particularly over what people in the U.S. would call a housing project between Pagford and Yarvil, and the effectiveness of a drug rehabilitation center which the Pagford government controls.There's more:  Parents and teens disagree; this is natural, too, but for some families in the Pagford area there are serious consequences. Spouses have horrible quarrels among themselves, also with serious consequences.  There is indeed domestic abuse in this novel, as well as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use/abuse, teen and adult sexuality, and much foul language.The characters impress me as rather flat and stock.  There is the overweight parish councilor who feels that his son is an effeminate slacker.  There is the woman doctor with three children, one of whom is not as clever as the other two and is constantly put down for it, not just by her mother but by her schoolmates.  There is the bad girl from the wrong side of town with the big heart who is caring for her nursery-age brother because of her mother's drug habit.But the real mystery (at least, as far as the members of the Parish Council):  Who is posting the ""Ghost of Barry Fairbrother"" posts on the council website?  Is it one person, or several?  Why is this person/ these people doing this?So, in all honesty, Rowling has given us a Peyton Place in a British village.

One thing I quickly learned is that this wonderful author can still write characters we all care about. The book is told in a way that almost each chapter is given to a different family and we are almost flies on the wall watching and observing what is happening behind the closed doors of the town. Needless to say there is many secrets and scandals hidden in this ordinary town. There is sexually explicit parts in the book , and violence, and sexual violence towards children, drug abuse, self harm etc etc. The story is just about as different from Harry Potter as you can get, but saying that, for a lot of the adult Harry Potter fans I think they will enjoy it as a lot of care obviously went into the characters ,and their lives as I as a fan of the HP series was used to.This book is def not for children!!This book is nothing like the HP series but wonderful in it's own right!!!!The book is heartbreaking many times throughout, and my heart really went out to some of the characters and the lives they had. If it was possible to hug a character in a book then I would be giving huge hugs to Kristal and her brother Robbie. Their family life had me in tears towards the end of the book.Although the book is huge it does not feel like you are reading a massive book.

It is not Harry Potter (It is not even close to it, but is a whole different type of book) , but the plot, character studies, and the interactions of the people involved in it are as good or better than what you find in Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.  JK Rowling has done a superb job of looking below the pretty, peaceful surface of the village of Pagford, and has shown it is really a seething cauldron of interacting characters, who attack, take advantage of, and support one another in a variety of ways.  And, the touch at the end, where Howard Mollison's favorite song &#34;The Green, Green, Grass of Home&#34; in which a man awakes to find his homecoming to his lovely old home town was nothing but a dream, and the reality is that this is the last morning of his life on death row, is a beautifully done touch as a foreshadowing of what will happen next.

My commute is short and after a couple of days I was so hooked that getting a part of a chapter a day was not going to cut it and I wasn't willing just to drive around town aimlessly to listen to more of the story, so I picked up a copy in order to read it faster.I was surprised to hear that this book originally did not receive very good reviews from critics. There is not a lot charm and wonder in this story - it is very real and examines people's true, and generally petty, motives. In fact it is so real in it's characterizations that it could be a true story. The best part of the book is how perfectly Rowling inter-meshes the lives of her characters, and how completely she fills out their lives and motivations for us lucky readers to view. She is such a master at capturing motivation, habit, and emotion that her book's characters truly come alive to the reader.I found this book to be fascinating because the character who dies in the first few pages in order to create &#34;the casual vacancy&#34; on the parish council remains a huge part of the book, yet we never get inside his head the way we get to with the other characters.

Surely those people have watched an R-rated movie before.In my opinion this book was great. It was real. Real life isn't neat, PG-rated, loose endings don't tie up in nice little bows. People are hypocrites, junkies, heroes. People are flawed and some never learn or change, they remain in horrible relationships or refuse to get off drugs. Others succeed against the odds, show kindness and try to live their lives to make the lives of others better. Some kids are bullies and cowards, others are couragous when least expected.

But it's honest and there is beauty even in the tragic aspects of the book. One must have patience to read this book, one cannot want the easy narrative or solution.

The story is filled with a wide cast of characters, each of whom is given time in the third person narrative to become truly fleshed out human beings with both admirable traits and understandable flaws. No character is let off the hook from being scrutinized and yet each differing opinion offered, each inner life exposed, make the characters each likable in his or her own way and their motives understood by the reader.She weaves this cast through a simple story line: a small town recovering from and responding to the death of a local man and to the vacancy he leaves on the local town council. Yet the story is far from simple as each character's rich inner life creates it's own sub-plot that spider-webs it's way out from the primary story. What we see in each sub-plot makes us wish individual dreams will come true and makes the reader dream of a better life for these fragile humans.Rowling ties each of these characters together through the events of the story and while not every turn in the story is a surprise she has the courage to take the story to an ultimate climax that is not entirely expected. It left me weeping with real tears for the characters I had grown, so quickly, to believe I knew as people.More over, Rowling's deft use of wildly differing characters, and the ways in which they all come in contact with one another, left me pondering the way in which our very social fabric is interwoven and questioning whether or not we can ever do enough for one another.Forget about Harry Potter, as good as it is, this is not a fantasy story or a story for children.

I mean, let's be honest - Harry Potter made me fall in love with reading. I hoped for an owl to drop a letter from Hogwarts on my doorstep on my 11th birthday. How on earth could she top that?Oh my lanta.The Casual Vacancy begins with Barry Fairbrother's death, leading the whole town slowly into a state of pure and utter chaos. Barry seemed to be the man who held the shaky glue of the parish together, but with him gone, the entire house of cards simply collapses.I will admit, I found the synopsis a little dry, but the book itself had such beautiful language, it made my little English major heart go pitter-pat. And the intricacy of the plot: everyone was connected to everyone, in some way, shape or form. Everyone has a secret. I don't want to go into character motives or plot too much (I really want you guys to read this!), but I will say I was astounded at the depths of the characters (although I shouldn't have been - look at Harry Potter). I loved how she incorporated different aspects of the British culture (varying accents, for example) as well as the prejudices and pride that each character carries around in their heart.This book astounded me, and while it took me a few chapters to sink in, I wasn't able to put it down after 50 pages. The characters are so vibrant, so intricate, that I forgot I was sitting in the break room at work - instead I was transported into the chaotic, drama-filled world of Pagford, following each character's story and constantly viewing the others from different sides.

I was well aware prior to purchasing that this would be a book for adults.  However, I expected an R rating, not a XXX.  There was really no way to know how objectionable the content could be prior to purchasing.  I gave her 2 stars for being an exceptional writer but other than that could find nothing redeeming about this book.  There is simply no reason to stuff every political-social-economic topic available into 500 pages of print.  The characters were polarized, not dynamic the way most people really are (ex. Snape), with their good and bad qualities. Many reviewers may object, but I feel like JKR does have somewhat of an obligation to consider the audience that brought her so much success.  Those who say she should be allowed to just follow her ""creative muse"" are those who like it.  Also what about the HP readers transitioning into adulthood who pick up this book?  It is being sold by the cash registers in my local BJ's!!  There should be a sticker on the cover indicating strong adult themes.  In addition no excerpts were offered of the book so that the reader could get an idea of what they were getting into.  Many authors offer that prior to the book being released.  All-in-all, I felt duped. And yes, I object to the Kindle price - probably determined by her publisher (I am not sure).  It seems somewhat disingenuous for a women who gained her early success while on welfare, to now be charging an arm and a leg for a book, much more than most authors, for a book with controversial content.  I am an avid reader, and spend thousands of dollars a year stocking up my kindle.

"0316228532","A31VFVN93LPCEQ","emilie00","A casual vacancy","Very clever premise, very complex interwoven plot. Enjoyable seeing teen characters as major players in an adult novel The most interesting character- `Fats'- lovely. The story saved by being balanced. It didn't condemn the middle classes while it poked derisive fun?  Didn't condemn anyone specifically- all of us- antiheroes.  I thought it less about class distinctions and more about human condition. Soul has to express itself someway - rare heroes like Barry Fairbrother make the most of what life has to offer while the majority  of us squabble & squander it tragically. The internet shown as a damaging force- Fat's facebook bullying- but also as a positive force for the silent sufferers - Andy & Suhkvinder  who found a voice  there & got their messages across.There's a strong medical flavor to it I felt. Those ethical questions about whether we treat those who won't help themselves-  we do make circumstantial allowances for poverty, abuse, depression, mental illness - but where do we draw the line. Is the isolated teen being harassed on facebook anymore needy than the girl with a heroin addicted mum?  It's the same- everyone's trauma just as important? Excuses are made for the socially disadvantaged here but no effort made to excuse that morbidly obese shopkeeper? He could have been insulin resistant, or comfort eating to help cope with a most awful marriage etc.  But otherwise all dysfunctionality- mental & physical- (one leads to the other- inseparable?)  was exonerated by either a character's situation, their past, their personalities or even that they just `didn't get it' . The Harry Potter caricatures are exaggerations of very real people- we all have some of that in us?  Showed I thought an understanding that we all have some inner `pain'- regardless of class or circumstance- just that the middle/upper classes are shielded - and  maybe  often unable to appreciate basic important truths the way less fortunate are forced to. Fats went searching for that- was what he needed -& he got it, poor child. He had the teenager's certainty that he knew the truth, that life is so simple and he failed to see that the polite lies adults tell are recognition that it's all more complex- that we can never know other people's circumstances, so we choose to keep `inauthentic' so we won't hurt them. Assumptions fool all of us always regardless of social situation.  The shielding effect of affluence helps the individual (if not society) - is maybe an extremely mentally healthy & adaptive thing- that ability to block out ugly inconvenient truths- all important for a building of the ego enabling  growth, enjoyment, discovery, achievement  and apathy? But shielding occurs also for those severely disadvantaged like Terry -where there is an important  need to dissociate self from terrible, inconvenient- nasty  truths.Was it saying- that there is often suffering involved in insight-that the great tragedy of human condition  is that those with most need understand our world best - but have the least opportunity  or capacity  to act, force change? Their suffering, subjugation  cripples them ? It takes unusual strength- Krystal (almost) & Barry had it. But its not limited to underclass as shown by Suhkvindar. Great achievers are more likely to come from priviledge- but this story isn't about that. It's about all those who waste their advantages- have all the brutal confidence & power- but who squander it- being cowardly, without insight & blinded by comfort.Free will? Man prides himself on this- we make all other processes adjust to support what we decide to do. Story heavily underlines how bad decisions made, always have serious consequences & what goes around -comes around? - a constant theme of novels last century.  But does story ask, does it exist? Brave decisions or bad decisions- here the privileged seem in no better a physical or psychological state to exercise it properly- they are too, too anaesthetised by all their selfish comfort to make an effort or to understand what is needed- they squander it. We are shown it takes tragedy & suffering to see injustice most clearly - here insight is only forced by brutal circumstance? But the sufferers struggle most to exercise free will- since their suffering emasculates them. All heroes in this story come from deprived backgrounds & class doesn't define this - so I don't think it blames the middle class- a detail that makes the story acceptable for me.The medical point is made about grossly obese shop keepers who cost the health system  but they simply don't get it- & why should they. And Sukhvindar's  parents -a very imperfect medico family -a nice touch- as flawed as anyone here.  Parminder could have helped Howard if she had wished & we see how in  caring for the physical health of her patients - she terribly mentally , physically damaged her daughter-  Unreasonably she applies the same rigid punitive  conduct she must apply to herself - to her daughter who also is made to  suffer the emotional  neglect that goes with all consuming responsibilities. Cleverly we see Parminder will get off- it's council rules.So many characters- I struggled and concentrated on the main ones. The ending is optimistic- the 2 most misguided characters have an epiphany  and they change- though realization is only forced by tragedy- hope for us all.So much work has gone into this? - I liked it that the author democratically doesn't exempt herself from these flaws.",4,"10 18, 2012",1350518400,"[3, 4]"

It was opportunity that made Ron great.  He had the opportunity to shine (and to fail) because of the adventures and troubles his friends got him into.This novel is about the forgotten Ron Weasleys, the teens who we never gave an opportunity to shine, the children we ignored and dismissed.  Rowling isn't just writing an extraordinary novel, she's also sending a message.  She's trying to wake up this generation of adults and remind them that our children-not just biological children but all the children of our community-are our responsibility.  We can't ignore them, we can't be absent, they cannot become the casualty of our self absorption. The title The Casual Vacancy is not just about an open seat on the local city council, but about how we are casually vacant, absent when this growing generation of kids and teens need us to be present.  In this way, this book is very much a book from the creator of Harry Potter.  In the Potter books, Rowling tells children they can be amazing.

I'm giving it 100 pages before I abandon it and I'm just a few pages short when Amazon emailed the urge to review. Okay. It's not that it isn't about magic; it's not that it's not Harry Potter; it's that is written as if it is purposely trying to not be lyrical, beautiful, or incisive in its style. I get it that it's a trend these days for authors to write each new book in a different style, but I must ask, Why? This might have made it as a short story. The writing is blocky, trudging, decidedly pedestrian. Every now and then there is a funny moment, a witty observation, an incisive scene, as when the social worker tries to interview the junkie mother with the hungry toddler running around in wet diapers, risking his life as he fights the already entrenched negligence. But there are so many characters, most of whom seem to be short and squat or tall and obese, it is difficult to keep them straight.One reviewer asked, in response to negative responses to the grim setting and bleak outcome, if we would dismiss the merits of &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; or &#34;The Bluest Eye&#34; because they were depressing. Also mentioned were &#34;1984&#34; and I would add anything by Dickens. No we wouldn't, but boy, &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; should not even be mentioned in the same sentences with these masterpieces. Steinbeck, Morrison, Orwell, and yes, Dickens, the writers of these classic revelations of oppression via class, race, age, sex, technology put their full talent not just to the story but to the writing! As Rowling seemed to have done with Potter (more in the first three than the last, I will say). The stories might have been horrific, but the writing was beautiful, evocative, dare I say transformational. It is the use of the elevated tools of the trade that elevates an expose to literature. It was how books such as those were able to dig into us and rip our hearts out and our minds open. Not this book, not even close. Rowling's clear ability, proven in the Harry Potter series, to write the range of life in soaring prose, seems to have been put aside here in service of . . . what? Bland writes bleak? Mechanical describes mechanistic?  Had she pulled it off in 35 pages rather than taking over 500 to do so, there might be a reason to plod in the style.

That being said, if you are a fan of JK Rowling's writing abilities/story telling capabilities, then read on.The story has a slow start, with character introduction being key.  Once you get through the intro of characters, the story is told in true JK Rowling fashion. She weaves a story with great character development, as everyone's lives intersect and outcomes of their lives are dependent upon others' decisions...true to real life.  The setting in itself is a character, but not so in a primary role, more of a support to the main characters.  If you have ever lived in a small town, you will relate to this story and the workings of the town and it's surroundings. If you haven't lived in a small town, I still think you will relate to the story, simply because you are alive and it is so true to life.Overall, this book should have a high rating. It is a gritty story that makes you care about the characters, despise the characters, understand the workings of how despite good intentions, bad things can still happen, and vice versa.

"0316228532","A386UNUYDUDSBB","E. Smiley","Brilliant in unexpected ways","This is not my usual genre. For me books about modern life generally fall into at least one of the following categories: pretentious, boring, saccharine or trashy. So I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book, which I read out of curiosity; in fact I was completely sucked in, living in the book rather than merely reading it.The Casual Vacancy is not plot-driven, but essentially, it follows six or seven families in a small English village after the death of a prominent town councillor. Local politics is key, but just as much time is spent on the often fraught relationships between people. There's no clear protagonist, with about a dozen major characters and many minor ones, and the point-of-view constantly shifts among them in a way that could have been annoying, but works. Others have been bored, but I found the pacing excellent, in large part because there are so many interlocking stories: I would not read a book about any one of these individual plotlines, but as is we don't spend enough time with any one character for their story to drag or become too mundane. And Rowling deserves her reputation as an excellent storyteller; I really was fascinated throughout.As for the characters, I was impressed. Characterization isn't one of the Harry Potter books' strongest suits (those being plot, inventiveness and humor), but here everyone is realistic and human. The portrayals are often unflattering: people are self-absorbed, petty, or complacent, family relationships are conflict-ridden, and people deal with issues that may not be apparent from the outside, such as domestic violence, mental illness or drug abuse. Everyone has character flaws. But that's life. Despite a few false notes, such as one sudden transformation at the end, I thought it was brilliant, and no, I didn't hate everyone in the cast any more than I hate everyone in my real life. One of the book's strengths is that everyone has genuine flaws, no one is universally liked by the other characters, and yet you can sympathize or identify with many of the characters (provided you're not expecting clear-cut heroes and villains), and every reader's reactions to them will be a little different. (Reading reviews, I've seen probably 10 different characters cited as people's favorites or ""the only person I could stand""--not many books can do that. For the record, I identified strongly with Parminder, which isn't a reaction anyone else seems to have had.)Stylistically, the prose here is much like in the Harry Potter books: functional, but unlikely to win literary awards anytime soon. The one thing that irritated me was the phonetic language that's (over-)used for the lower-class characters: not sure what notable difference Rowling sees in the pronunciation of ""wuz"" and ""duz"" versus ""was"" and ""does""--mostly this just makes those characters look stupid, which I doubt is her intention.This book has taken some flak for being heavy-handed. I'll admit to a high tolerance for this as long as it's not at the expense of character development; I don't mind that the book is a parable about the importance of caring for our neighbors, nor that the climax reproduces the parable of the good Samaritan. Crucially, Rowling puts realism before her message; the book has been called ""Dickensian,"" but when Dickens created poor children for readers to pity, he made them angelic. Krystal, the troubled teen around whom the book revolves, is the opposite: she's rude and aggressive and often irresponsible, she steals and curses and sleeps around--while she seems to have a good heart and the potential to do better, she's anything but romanticized. And the characters whose opinions Rowling probably agrees with (aside from the deceased Barry) are no more idealized, while the ones she probably doesn't are hardly villainous--the smug, conservative Howard Mollison, for instance, seems a decent parent and grandparent.Finally: I think those who hate all the characters are taking this book the wrong way. Yes, everyone's flawed, but.... they're just people. Yes, the book criticizes middle-class complacency.... but I doubt Rowling could have written it without empathy for everyone involved. In the end, the point of all this is that we can't hope to do better if we fail to see the humanity in everyone--even those who might at first seem irredeemable.So, should you read this book? Yes--if you don't mind the inclusion of sex, swearing, domestic abuse, drug addiction, etc.; if you're willing to read about the relationships and politicking of flawed characters in a small town; if you aren't looking for fantasy or anything like Harry Potter. As a reader who grew up with Harry Potter but has since moved on to adult books, I absolutely found it worth my while.",4,"10 15, 2012",1350259200,"[22, 24]"

So when I saw you were releasing a new book, I honestly felt I owed it to you to purchase it and try it out, in thanks for the years of enjoyment of your writing. I was truly excited about it. I counted down the days to the release. I in no way expected it to be a Harry Potter-level masterpiece. I did, however, expect your novel to be interesting and enjoyable. I regret to say that, though I go typically through books with enthusiastic fervor, it took me over a month to finish your book. I can finish just about any book in two days flat if I'm enjoying it. I soak up the written word like a very thirsty sponge. But I just could not get into this book. I could not in any way get excited for what would happen next. It seemed to me to be an overall aimless plot, topped off with a sad and dramatic ending that in no way matched the pace of the rest of the book. It was like boringboringboring, then BAM- dramatic, tragic ending. I really cannot understand what possessed you to write it. The petty happenings of small town life simply do not strike me as engaging subject matter. I feel there were too many characters (boring ones, at that). It took me at least until halfway through the book to even differentiate between them all. Overall, this book gave me a sad face :( At the least, I expected an entertaining read. This book was, simply put, a drag that I had to force myself to finish.I also felt your writing was needlessly crude. It was as if you were trying to force your way out of the YA genre by being vulgar (and I am by no means prudish or sensitive), and it honestly added nothing to your book. Why, though? You're such a great writer!I can forgive your mistake in writing this novel, though lol. I loved your other books so much that it more than makes up for this horrid flop. Just please don't do it again! :(And let me make it clear that it pains me to have to write this kind of review for you. The book just was not good, love. I very much regret having to write this!

There seemed to be a bit of poetic justice in the end when Howard has a heart attack and ends up being in the hospital for a long time.  The ending left me hanging a bit and I wish that it had continued on a bit more and not ended on such a sad note. I kept hoping that Barry Fairbrother would end up not being dead and would pop up at the council meeting when they voted on the Fields and Bellchapel. I thoroughly enjoyed the book the writing was excellent and the entire book was very descriptive. I found a few typos in the book mainly parentheses that shouldn't have been there.

I needed to say that first, because it's hard to write a positive review about a novel where characters are so flawed and difficult, especially when there's nothing flashy about their story.  I understand that when the stakes seem so low (a small town council seat) people compare them to the Good and Evil stakes of the Harry Potter books and find them wanting, but as happens in dismissive reviews of many of women writers who attempt this kind of novel, that seems like such stereotypical and lazy criticism.  How people live their daily lives is where it all starts.  How people express their compassion (or not) through local politics, through family politics, through personal whims and desires -- that's the basis for where we end up as a society.  The society Rowling presents is indeed petty and unforgiving (and at many instances unforgivable) yet why is showing it on a more personal level not praiseworthy?  Rowling takes on big topics -- various kinds of familial abuse, drug addiction, bullying -- from an everyday perspective, describing even the most unlikeable characters with both charity and open eyes.  She's especially good (no surprise) at getting into the minds of her teenage subjects, and unlike the mostly black-and-white characters of the Harry Potter books, these are kids I recognize, with complex motivations.  The crimes are (mostly) small-time and the acts of heroism are baby steps, but what can I say? it all rang true for me.

Pepoon","Lack of Character Development Is the Fatal Flaw","I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series and have read the books again and again, wondering at JK Rowling's ability to create a world so real and appealing that readers want to live there, and to create stories that are so compelling they become a part of a reader. Sadly, this book did not come close to either of those experiences. As any Harry Potter reader knows, character development is not one of Rowling's strengths, and this is the fatal flaw of the book. The teenage characters are more finely wrought than the adults (as was true for the Harry Potter series) and there are a few of these teenagers who are engaging. I wish Rowling had either focused on the teenagers' stories more or developed the adult characters. The plot is mildly interesting and kept me reading through 2/3 of the book, but at that point, the fact that I did not care enough about the characters to continue reading overcame any vested interest I had in the story line. Finishing the book was a chore, and I found the ending to be wholly unsatisfactory. I hate when authors kill off characters because they cannot figure out what should happen next, it is an insult to the readers. If Rowling had spent some time developing some of the adult characters - there are two women in particular who could have carried the book - this might have been more successful. Alternately, instead of starting the book with the death of a man who appeared throughout the tale to be one of the few with any morals, Rowling could have started with his story and had him die later, which would have created an interesting pivotal point in the plot and tension in the story.Certainly, the writing is very good; there are no issues with poor grammar and spelling as seen in far too many contemporary books. And Rowling's ability to create a fully formed world (the small village in which most of the story is set) is clearly apparent.

Pieterse","An odd book...","I will (like many others here) preface my review by saying definitively that ""The Casual Vacancy"" couldn't possibly be further removed from the land of Harry Potter. This is a mature book that aims to some extent to strike at the literary fiction market. One gets the feeling that Rowling has somehow made a challenge to herself to write something that is significantly more challenging (to read) than anything else she has accomplished; the challenge in this case lies in the equivocal portrayal of people in ""TCV"". It's this subtle point, I think, that many one-star reviews have failed to grasp: the human psyche is complex and can't help what it thinks - people are not simply ""good"" or ""evil"". Of course I sympathise with the expectations of her fans and their adventurous excursion to non-fantasy realms (many of my friends who only have read fantasy have dipped their toes in other waters for the first time with this book), however one must not approach a book with your own prejudices - absorb and discard that which appeals to you or has truth to it.The Casual Vacancy follows the lives of a large cast of characters (about 60 of them) in a small village in Britain; the way that they deal with each other and their loved ones - and the repercussions of those dealings, intended or not. It's a finely balanced novel, that is well thought-out; with the narratives eliding with ease. It's an excellent show of craftsmanship to blend these stories together and simultaneously keep them believable and interesting. There are many touching moments in the story, and many, many, many horrifying and gritty happenstances.  I felt, after reading the book, that I was genuinely interested and intrigued by the lives of the citizens of Pagford - my judgement of their actions are not important, what is important is the realism with which Rowling portrays the little undercurrents in human relations, the rancour and spite: the thoughts and feeling that we dare not admit to anyone (often, not even ourselves) that we have.People, are not nice. They are riddled with imperfections and often hurt one another by exploiting this precise fact - that is one of the topoi in the novel; to recognise that there are molesters, prostitutes, pedophiles, adulterers, and sometimes just plain nasty (Fats, I'm looking at you) individuals who roam among us under the guise of suburban bliss is to my mind, an important, albeit borrowed idea - that was excellently executed in the novel. Yes, the novel is harsh and at times distasteful, but that is no reflection of the novellist proper - Rowling is merely portraying the realities of her conception. Indeed, the novel has many other qualities that are notable - chief among them is her surprising ability to write beautiful sentences effortlessly.An endlessly fascinating account of how the pushes and pulls of daily life lead to inexorable conclusions and overarching, life-changing shifts in our understanding of how we relate to our family, friends, and community.

That's probably where this novel would have ended had it been submitted under another author-name.  I loved the Harry Potter series, not for it's world and fantasy elements, so much as Ms. Rowling's genius with character and character interactions.  I do enjoy a well-written fantasy world, but frankly, other authors have done that aspect more deftly than Ms. Rowling did.  Her characters, however, invite deserved comparisons with Dickens' own cast of unforgettables.  I wouldn't go so far as to say she reaches Dickens' level, by any means, but she certainly is one of the few to approach his style of handling fictional persons in so totally unfeigned a manner.However...all the above is merely to say that I wasn't in any way looking for more Harry Potter when I picked up &#34;Casual Vacancy&#34; this winter.  I'd been defending her new choice of subject matter to all the vocal critics around me, for months.  I thought--and I still do--that her greatest gifts could be allowed full reign if unencumbered by the demands of crafting an alternate universe.  In short, I was very open to whatever of her imagination I was about to find between the covers of her latest work.  I swear, I was!I couldn't finish this book.  It was sooooo dull.  I completely agree with the NY Times reviewer, Michiko Kakutani, who called the characters that inhabit Pagford, the village setting for &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34;, flat, and cardboard.I have to confess that I'm not a big fan of the literary fiction genre, where the purpose of characters seems to be to persuade the reader that human beings are basically an unlikeable species who'll never be invaded by aliens, because they'll have bored the alien scouts to death before an invasion could get organized.  So perhaps, since this novel clearly wants to be in the lit fic league, I'm a little biased.  However, I didn't set this book down simply because it reached after a literary style.  I set it down because it's author wanted me to follow the details of the lives of people she couldn't be bothered to like, herself.  And I just couldn't do it.  If there had been even one character whom the author loved, no matter how undeserving, that might have been enough to persuade me to stick in there, and see what she intended.  There wasn't, though, and I didn't.Every great artist has to produce a few stinkburgers in between the good stuff, and in my opinion, Rowling has shown herself a great artist.

"0316228532","A18FIHA7C2TJB4","Gabriella West","Like a 19th-century novel in many ways; Rowling's treatment of class goes deep","The novel is partially about Pagford's children warring against their parents, and that is certainly an enjoyable subject, one we can all relate to. But Rowling is not content to depict middle-class adolescent rebellion. She goes even deeper, exploring a family from the Fields housing estate, whose daughter, Krystal Weedon, goes to school with Andrew and his unpleasant friend ""Fats"" Wall. Krystal barely has a family at all: a mother, Terri, who's a chronic heroin addict and former prostitute, a little brother who is learning disabled and neglected. One of the most powerful scenes in the book is when social worker Kay comes to interview Terri and tries to get through to her that her son is in danger of being taken away. Terri is barely there, a wispy wretch of a woman who can scarcely form a coherent thought. Yet Kay, enmeshed in her own personal problems, has this unexpected insight: ""But not to feel, not to care... Right now, Kay thought, she's happier than I am.""Rowling's treatment of class goes deep. In fact, it's at the heart of the novel. Despite the miseries of the middle-class characters, their lives are not literally on the line. As I progressed through The Casual Vacancy, I had the unsettling feeling that most of the characters were doomed. But by the end, it's clear that the middle-class characters are essentially safe. It could be argued that Rowling denies some of her characters humanity in her rush to make the point that working-class characters are the true losers in modern English society.But Rowling's depiction of working-class life isn't boring--it's gripping. And she has done an amazing thing. She's made the pathetic figure of Terri Weedon human and relatable. When Rowling delves into Terri's terrible backstory, which unfolds as the matriarch of the family, Nana Cath, is dying, we are shown in flashback that Terri simply never had anyone to stand up for her. And the welfare state, as embodied by the careless and overstretched ""care"" of the social workers, just isn't good enough. Krystal, Terri's daughter, as feisty and strong as she appears externally, has had only one advocate, a man who's no longer there--Barry Fairbrother. In flashbacks we see that Barry, who grew up in the Fields himself, encouraged Krystal to join the school rowing team, which he coached, and amazingly they won... but Krystal's moment of glory was brief, and Barry's death has been devastating for her.I was deeply affected by The Casual Vacancy, and I didn't expect to be. There were moments in the book where I choked back tears. The most powerful moments were the swift flashes of insight, lyrically expressed. ""Was it love when somebody filled a space in your life that yawned inside you, once they had gone?"" a character asks herself. The internal worlds of the characters are fraught and lonely; each relationship Rowling examines seems frayed or deeply dishonest in a very true-to-life way.[This is just a portion of a much longer review I wrote of The Casual Vacancy.

"0316228532","A1GEXXOGYBMQUD","Gabrielle V ""Gabrielle du Vent""","Not for everyone. Obviously.","I am one of those who read HP on-time (I think I was about 10 when the first HP book got big). I enjoyed the series, although in the end I started to feel it got a little too battle-friendly. I enjoyed the boarding school atmosphere the same way I enjoyed Enid Blyton and Tom Brown as a child, not magic battles. I'd go to other authors for that.That being said, I read The Casual Vacancy, and I can see why there are almost equal amounts of 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 star reviews. Let me explain.The premise is an English town. Middle-class town. Small. This is different from any other country's ""small town"", and it may be difficult for, say, an American small-town dweller to understand the underlying emotional currents that moves throughout the book. It may also be difficult for those who have not attended (or have children who have attended) British comprehensive secondary schools to understand just what is going on amongst the children. It is not supposed to be bloody. It's not supposed to have shoot-outs. It's also not supposed to be dramatic, because English people do not like ""drama"". Sure, we have drama - all people do - but ""hanging on in quiet desperation"" is the English way. Calmly observing a suicide would be the English way (a la Evelyn Waugh). A detached observation of the macabre is the English style in my opinion, such as Anthony Burgess or Graham Greene. It is not supposed to make anyone a villain or a hero.So if you are looking for a clear black and white, then this book isn't for you. If you are looking for heroism and ""I tried hard and I succeeded"" story, this isn't for you either. If you do not really have a life-shattering problem in your life but feel that something somewhere went wrong and want to read about that, this book is for you.The book does not deal with starvation, serious abuse (I'm talking about The Child Called It level here), rape (Colour Purple level), but rather deals with the enclosed, seemingly peaceful society that is rotting from the core. It's not a ""fun"" read. It's not supposed to ""move"" you. But it does deal with all the ugliness that we, as a society, tend to close eyes to: covert racism, neglect, rape, drug abuse, societal elitism, the middle-class ""it's not happening to me so I'll close my eyes"" attitude that leaves people like Krystal Whedon behind. We donate money, talk about these people as numbers, but very rarely do we face them individually, and even more rarely do we actively do something against it. ""I feel bad but I do have my life"" is the general tone, which presents as a duality that permeates this novel. It deals with the superficial peace and the torrent of strife that dwells beneath.The children, much rawer than the adults, shove those dualities into the adults' faces. This seems more evident amongst comprehensive schools, but you really have to ""feel"" - not know, but feel - the British class system in order to see the gross dichotomy. But the children are also without direction and while trying their best to live as they see fit, they do not know the core truths to the values they are petitioning for. Family is important - but Krystal does not know why. Honesty is precious - but Fats can't tell between ""honesty"" and ""selfishness"". Maintaining peace is crucial - but Simon does not know when to speak up and when to accept, possibly because they are ""taught"" that these values are precious and important, but do not know (or think) about why.To those who are considering purchasing this book, I suggest reading this not as a ""novel"", but rather social criticism. It might be difficult for the non-English to empathise with any character in this book, due to the lack of experiences. (I went to an independent and lived in a fairly large town, so I found it a little difficult to empathise as well... I don't ""feel"" the enclosedness of Pagford, as it's 30 minutes to London from where I used to live.) But this book does deal with many social problems that are half-heartedly addressed but aren't really focused on in today's society (a lot of issues that get raised in this book seem to get ""yeah yeah, old story"" reactions when you actually try to discuss it). So the book does do a good job on that aspect.All in all, 4 stars. It does a good job portraying the English town to English people, but it probably won't translate to those outside the Isles.",4,"08 14, 2013",1376438400,"[0, 0]"

"0316228532","A2XZKGL6DJA03","Gary Hoggatt","Rowling's novel is well-written, but just too small, petty, and brutally depressing","I'm a big Harry Potter fan.  Okay, so that out of the way, I was obviously looking forward to seeing what J.K. Rowling would do with her first post-Potter book, 2012's The Casual Vacancy.  In her new novel, Rowling displays her usual ability to build deep characters and intricate plots.  Unfortunately, all the characters are so dreary, being pitiful, a jerk, or a pitiful jerk, and and the plot so full of life-at-it's-smallest drama that you feel beaten down by the end.  Maybe that's what she's was going for.First off, there's a large, large cast, with a lot of complicated relationships.  That's fine.  Large casts don't bother me.  But I did feel like it took me half the novel just to finally keep straight who everyone was, and meanwhile, the plot was moving very, very slowly.  And the characters themselves, as I described above, are just so hard to care about.  There's no protagonist, it's a definite ensemble book, and no one is entirely on the right side of anything.  Rowling appears to be trying to put as many flaws as she can into the cast, and it becomes depressing.  Everyone has some terrible thing that's happened to them in their life that has scarred them.  At the same time, everyone is horrible to at least one other person in town.  Just when you feel sorry for someone about the first angle, they go and screw over someone else to fulfill the second.Are the characters interesting?  Yes.  Do I like any of them?  Not really.  Are some of them sort of understandable in why they do what they do.  Yes, but I still don't like them.  And then there are a few who seem to be unremitted jerks.  Simon Price has no redeeming features, doing nothing but committing theft and beating his family.  Maybe he was abused as a child, too, and Rowling forgot to mention it.  And then there's my absolute least favorite character, Stuart ""Fats"" Wall, the teenager who seems to be trying to take his Holden Caulfield impersonation up to ""11.""  Since I didn't care for Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye, this didn't do much for me.  And he and his quest for ""authenticity"" leave a path of destruction in his wake that screws up the life of just about anyone who ever so much as has been in the same room with him.The plot is divided into two main threads, with a lot of smaller threads going on alongside and weaving through them.  First is the politicking for the vacant council seat, which is just so petty and horrible that it's depressing.  The other is the ""wrong part of town"" Weedon family. They're also depressing, but at least the miserableness of their lives truly is misery.  The Weedons are the horrors of drugs, poverty, and social apathy writ large.The Casual Vacancy is a tough book to like.  Rowling has certainly produced a well-written book, but I just can't get past how small, petty, depressing, and dreary the world it depicts is.  I kept wishing there was someone, anyone, I could root for, instead of feeling like I watching dozens of slow-motion train wrecks.  I think, overall, Rowling has done what she set out to do in The Casual Vacancy, but it just isn't a book I can really recommend to anyone who's enjoyed her other work.  If you like books about the small dramas of modern life, this will be just your thing, but unfortunately, I'm not in that category.",2,"10 24, 2012",1351036800,"[6, 8]"
"0316228532","A2KJZXIXBHVG0K","Gary Severance","Social Vortex","J. K. Rowling's novel, The Casual Vacancy, is a very good British village story that captures the atmosphere of a setting US readers may never experience directly. There is a long history of novelists writing in this tradition, one that comes to mind immediately is Simon Brett whose novels involve local mystery stories. I enjoy this style because of the detailed descriptions of the characters and their interactions. A key to this type of fiction is the sharply drawn images of individual emotions of the characters. The presentation of the emotional reactions of the characters is precise, and it is clear to the reader exactly what the characters are going through. This is very difficult to do, and Rowling writes with insight demonstrating a mastery of the technique.The story of the sudden death of a councilman in the small town of Pagford and the politics of a variety of personalities attempting to continue the council's agenda is enjoyable. I like the structure of the novel, like a spiral that starts with a broad circumference and continues in narrower bands as the novel progresses. Characters are drawn from the mundane routines of their daily lives into the vortex of interaction involving the troubling issues of family problems, jealousy, envy, snobbery, poverty, racism, drug abuse, encroaching public housing, hopelessness, child abuse, self-mutilation, displacement, rehabilitation, and possibly fleeing Pagford for a location with less personal involvement with society. The tightening swirl of the action forces all of the important characters to make decisions that they once thought were not required in an idyllic British village.Although The Casual Vacancy is certainly no British cozy, the reader will love the village and the people (some more than others) who are drawn into the spin of upsetting life events precipitated by the death of a charismatic town fixer. In the end, you will be forced to make decisions like the characters to accept the responsibilities and commitment of a local community or flee to the much less connected life of larger cities. There were a few parts of the novel (within a few scenes) in which the thread of the narrative was a bit stretched if not broken, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",4,"11 23, 2012",1353628800,"[1, 1]"

I read the book compulsively on my Kindle, and my interest never lagged. The town of Pagford, England, is peopled by Rowling with a wide-ranging assortment of characters, whose thoughts propel the story. I'm reminded of John Updike and early Stephen King (before verbosity took over), who are unsurpassed at getting inside their characters' heads. Some who didn't like this novel have complained that the characters were unlikable, that they had no redeeming qualities. I would ask these critics about the innermost thoughts of their own friends and neighbors, and even themselves. If we knew what everyone was really thinking, would we find them likable? Would we want others to know our own innermost thoughts? A writer does not operate under these constraints and is under no obligation make her characters user friendly. Rowling's characters wish ill of others, swear, have sex, smoke and drink, abuse those close to them, and even take drugs. In other words, they are real people.From the moment that Barry Fairbrother dies in the opening pages, leaving his position on the Pagford town council vacant, skirmishes break out between the other council members as well as their adolescent children. The bone of contention is the Fields, an undesirable part of the community characterized by sub-standard housing and people--at least in the eyes of some of Pagford's respectable citizens. These skirmishes escalate to a full-blown war by the novel's denouement, leaving tragedy in their wake.  Happy or sad, it is a war worth reading about. Rowling's language is at times exquisite, and the motivations of her characters are explored masterfully.",5,"11 24, 2012",1353715200,"[1, 1]"

The disdain her narrator expresses for these bumbling do-gooders (Kay and Tessa and Parminder) in her descriptions of them reveals to some extent her own attitude.  Why else would the narrator describe them in such negative terms?  Howard Mallinson (ok, she kind of got the name right) is beneath contempt because he is obese?  This is the narrator's perspective.  Yes he is selfish and inconsiderate and a lecher.  Focus on those qualities, not his obesity.  Did Rowling think we could forgive the others but not the obesity?

"0316228532","A21OCAU9QFH5PJ","Glass House Reviews","A Study in Craft","Following the immensely successful Harry Potter series is no easy feat, and I can completely understand Rowling's decision to avoid all similarities to the magical world she created.While I definitely enjoyed this book, I'm certain I would not have bothered to read it had it not been penned by this author. In the back of my mind, I constantly compared it to her earlier work, marveling at the differences. In Vacancy, the characters -- all of them -- are much more developed than even the central cast of the Potter books. We see their deepest motivations (which are primarily ugly). We see their pains, their fears, their delusions, and their machinations. It's as if Rowling wanted to display the exact opposite of the epic and altruistic battle between good and evil, taking us instead into the minutae of disparate individual hungers.Unlike Potter, no character is 100% likeable or 100% detestable. Unlike Potter, each central character (and there are many) is a point-of-view character. Rowling slips almost seamlessly from one voice to the next quite frequently, something for which a less famous writer would be chastised (and mercilessly edited). Her ability to make each character distinct is impressive, as is her precise use of analogies to nail character traits and feelings.The plot itself is a cause-and-effect character study rather than a traditional 3-act play structure. Each act of fear, desperation, revenge, and rage cascades through the Pagford populace like an emotional avalanche.I felt the conclusion somewhat rushed, even though I was more than ready for resolution in the characters' sorry lives. While I have absolutely no desire to revisit Pagford or its denizens, I think Vacancy has the potential to become a quite popular television program. I also believe it would be excellent material for study in writing courses.~ Mia House(c) Glass House Reviews",4,"02 26, 2013",1361836800,"[0, 0]"

This work describes the society we live in, the good, the bad and the ugly are revealed, and the reality, the motives, the vanities, and a wealth of other human failings are revealed and offered up or consideration.I really found the book hard to get into as the initial chapters describe in detail all the characters, with very little story line to go on, but in hind sight, this had to happen. In towns where everyone thinks they know everyone else, all the petty little details are important in the workings & interactions of the community. We are forced to become as judgemental as the characters themselves, as their failings, petty jealousies and selfishness are exposed.There are some pretty awful examples of parents on parade, and maybe that's another example of a fundamental failing in our society.

But it does share that same sense of small town British life, and certainly the characters are interesting and well-developed.So to read this as a work of fiction, of character development, of interweaving personalities and family crises and secrets, it's quite good.  Rowling does have a really good sense of teenagers and their issues, and I thought these characters rang true, although it's a pretty dark view of relationships, families, and marriage for sure.There is nothing magical about this book, and it's hard to believe that it actually was written by the same imagination that spawned the Potter books, but that's okay and it really can't be judged in the same way at all.I do think that the book would have been helped by having a frontpiece with the names of characters and relationships of family members, and perhaps a written map of the areas in question, which we have often seen in books like these.

However, I did expect the creativity and imagination that this author is justly famous for.Nearly a century ago Agatha Christie created the town of St. Mary's Mead with Miss Marple (whose mind was compared to a kitchen sink).  Pagford of this book is a 21st century version. As with Christie, who had some equally uni-dimensional characters as this author has created, small town indiscretions are supposed to enthrall us and have us extrapolate this so called microcosm of society to the wider world. However, while Christie was entertaining and fun with no pretensions to ""world changing"" or ""intellectual commentary"", this was one grim, boring, pointless peroration.I am amazed that swearing, sex (mind-numbingly boring gropes), equally boring fantasies, thoughts of petty revenge for petty grievances and plain old boring gossip, makes this an 'adult' book.I appreciate the author's desire to show us she is capable of more than what we expect of her but this is certainly not it.",2,"10 2, 2012",1349136000,"[19, 27]"

I know I should  read it and appreciate its merit since I'm certain based on the third of it that I did read that it will provide numerous thesis and dissertation writers with new grain for their scholastic mills.Rowling is an undoubtedly skilled writer who turns out to be far more versatile than the Harry Potter series would suggest. I give her much credit for having more depth as a writer than I suspected, thus three stars instead of the two I'd rather give it. But that's just me at my stage in life, which I'll get to shortly.Grimly realistic is it EVER! Definitely a comedy of manners that skewers masterfully the pettiness and provincialism of small town politics and people without neglecting the simple pleasures that make small town living worthwhile. The overblown sense of self-importance that invests the drive to fill their casual vacancy is an unpleasant reality in many small towns. Those who think that comedy means LOL humor will be sorely disappointed as a result. That's not what a comedy of manners is, hence my saying that this book will be much dissected by English majors.As for me, I want characters that I can become involved with and situations with a resolution that leaves me feeling as satisfied as when I've eaten precisely the right amount of well-prepared food. This is not that sort of book, and oftentimes I thought that Rowling overdid the description to the point of tedium. The book could easily have been one or two hundred pages shorter. There was frequently too much of a muchness.Personally, the many f-bombs didn't bother me; they seemed to befit the characters dropping them, especially those doing so repeatedly. People bothered by stark realism that incorporates believable profanity should avoid this book without a doubt.It is definitely not a book for children. In fact, I doubt that any but the most intellectually mature teenager will get very far into it and appreciate it for what it is.You've now proven you're a writer of depth and merit, Ms. Rowling.

""Holly Whitman""","Garbage - don't waste your money","I wanted to write a review on this book after the first 50 pages and not finish reading it but after reading reviews by people condescendingly declaring that they actually read the whole book before writing, I decided to gag it down and eventually write one. If I can spare just one person this distracted and ill-conceived tome, it will be worth it.I love and adore the Harry Potter series. I believed that Ms Rowling showed a true gift for story-telling for young people in a way that also entertained older people, as well, but they were most definitely geared toward kids. I read and re-read them to my son. I edit books for a friend and am very alert to typos and misspellings that are easy for an author to make and the Harry Potter was so clean and free of those. Not so for Vacancy. It was undertaken so carelessly, as if Ms Rowling felt she must churn out something to placate her reading public, turning her back on the audience she was so suited for and targeting adults, for whom her writing is not suited, causing her editor to fail to find the mistakes, as that would require reading all of that book.The book was dreary, depressing, and focused on the nasty, back-biting traits of small-minded, petty people to a huge degree. I was starting to wonder if that is just how the British generally behave as a whole. That is certainly not my experience as an American, and it was depressing and disheartening through and through. Where people in many communities here rise up to help those in need in their communities, and to help those in other countries as well, the characters in this book treat people with disdain, disrespect, unkindness, or indifference, and this kind of behavior was the norm, not the exception. It painted a picture of whole communities of snobby, petty people always looking for weakness in others to exploit in some way, whether for gain, entertainment, or comparison to bolster some kind of pride, even when in the act of so-called helping them. It was sickening to live for any length of time with those people.Ms Rowling's portrayal of the sexuality of the young people in this book seemed, to me, to be inappropriate, graphic, and disgusting. Her omniscient writing style - which bounced us unmercifully, sometimes confusingly, and often randomly, through the minds of all of her characters - gave the expression TMI (too much information) new meaning. It seemed over the top, disgusting, and inappropriate to be focusing so deeply and graphically on what those teens were doing and why. As one who works with abused and neglected teenagers, I found it disturbing for an adult to be so focused in such a graphic and disgusting way on this aspect of those teenagers, both on their actions and their thoughts. I also kept thinking that this was just another book written for kids disguised as a book for adults, as the main characters focused on were the teens, with the adult dramas related to the teens secondary in importance; In fact, it was as if the adults were only there to prop up the appearance that this is a novel for adults. I guess if you are an adult who wishes to be forever a teenager then maybe?Overall, I simply could not believe this is the same person who wrote the Harry Potter series. It's so foreign to her former work that I have to wonder who actually wrote either Harry Potter or this book. I do not recognize her style at all and I believe she utterly failed in her attempt to transition as a writer for adults. If she wants to write for adults, she needs to write about adults. If she has such disturbing fantasies about teenagers and this was, in her mind, the only socially acceptable way to write about it, then that explains this work a bit better. Personally, as an adult I have no interest whatsoever in the private thoughts and behavior of random teenagers. I had enough of it with my own passage through those challenging times, which were in no way remotely like Ms Rowling's teens' experiences.If you like depressing, poorly written, confusing, random writing that offers no redeeming hope, value, or goodness and ends badly for all involved, then this is the book for you. I never read books like this and it was only because of my love for this author's previous books that I slogged and suffered through this mess. I will not bother with reading her work ever again unless she returns to writing for kids and makes sure she has the same quality editing that the Harry Potter books had. I have learned from reading reviews here that I can't trust the reviews, either, as there were several who highly praised this garbage.

What happens next is WHY the Bible tells us God keeps vengeance strictly for himself!!An ensemble cast of characters who are vividly drawn and well-developed tell the rest of the story, though it is not told in first person.

The teenagers, the law partners, the Deli Owner and his wife, the addict Mom in the projects (""Council Housing"" in the UK) and her very vulnerable little boy as well as the dissatisfied wife of one of the attorneys, the spurned girlfriend who has ruined her life moving to the village--it's quite a cast.

Now that I am almost finished, I have nothing but praise for her literary efforts. She has very cleverly taken an ordinary life situation in small-village England and turned it into an affair that packs a lot of energy balanced by an equal amount of pathos. The town of Yarvil has never really generated a lot love within its ranks, simply because its members would rather hate than help each other. There is no civil behavior here, especially when the future of the town is at stake and about to be settled in a by-election for a seat on the parish council, vacated by the sudden death of a popular teacher-advocate. There is a piece of land that is currently being used as the home of a popular drug rehab program, which has now come to the attention of a group who want to sell it for housing development. While the campaign heats up, all the innocence that we come to associate with backwater England disappears. There is a fair spate of nastiness in this story because its citizens don't empathize very well with the needs of its more vulnerable citizens - a generation of young druggies who are going through the rigors of rehab. To keep this novel current, Rowlings introduces the Internet as that weapon that will be used by both sides to wreck the other's chance of winning. In the end, all the political mudslinging will lead to disastrously unintended consequences. Someone who has no interest in dirty politics will lose bigtime only because she can't cope with the changes this vote will bring to her fragile life.",4,"07 17, 2013",1374019200,"[0, 0]"

It is a masterpiece that propels JK Rowling into another dimension of artistry.  I am a huge fan of her Harry Potter series and was aware that this novel was a deviation from children's lit into a more mature direction.  It is gritty, realistic, profane, sadistic, deeply disturbing in parts.  It challenges the reader to understand the characters motives and not judge them only on their actions.  At it's core, it is a character study that totally engages the reader and makes you care about the outcome for each character.  This book inspires comparison to some of my other favorite authors, Roddy Doyle and even Barbara Vine (minus the mystery).  Tom Hollander's narration was perfect in every way.  His vocal gymnastics portrayed each character with it's own voice and personality.  I have contemplated some of the negative reviews on this site and wonder if these reviewers would have been so harsh had the author not had another book series that had such an impact as HP.  Some reviewers seem almost angry that Rowling would deign to ""turn over the rock"" of the human experience and explore the ugliest aspects of life.  However, after reading this book, one comes away with a deeper compassion for others who we may have judged unfairly.  One sees her profound respect for the teenage trial --the terror and humilation of the teenage years that as adults we slowly forget.  Rowling allows her characters to adapt and to change for the better or worse. This book has inspired me to be more compassionate toward others and less judgemental.",5,"11 17, 2012",1353110400,"[1, 2]"

My next attempt was not much better. STILL BORING! Since there are so many books out there, and so little life, I vowed that my third try would be it.

"0316228532","A3LB6960BFMG09","Idle Expatter","Characters that stick with you; plot forgettable","I did not expect to like this, let alone like it a lot. What better praise can one give a novel than &#34;it surprised me&#34;?For me, now, looking back on this months after reading it, it is the characters that I remember most vividly. Many authors, it seems, fall into one of two camps: those who pour everything into two or three main characters and leave the rest of the cast as foggy and indistinct set decoration, and those who give every individual in the story, no matter how insignificant, a crass and vivid &#34;telling-not-showing&#34; veneer (like a carnival barker trying to draw you in to see some sideshow attraction).Ms. Rowling is something else. Like the carnival barkers, she does pay more attention than the norm to even the most minor characters. Yet she has a true gift for drawing surprisingly rich and complex portrayals from even the most basic of descriptions. And, as in that other thing she wrote, she displays a particular knack for younger characters, especially teens.Months after reading this as a breezy summer splash, I still clearly and distinctly remember the frustrated housewife with the heartbreaking obsession with the boy band; the young man with the hopeless and angry crush on the unattainable girl (with her own evocative past); the complexity of that man's friendship with his aimless friend; whose relationship with his father is so tormented...on and on it goes. By the end of the book, I felt like I had been living in Pagford myself all these years.Which brings me to Ms. Rowling's ability to take that cast of characters and their lives, and weave a tapestry of a setting from it. I grew up in a tiny town myself (though in New England, rather than old), and I think the author nailed the way a small town can become so entwined around itself - so insular and self-isolationist, particularly when there's another &#34;sexier&#34; town just over the next hill - that it sacrifices individual identities to a weirdly parochial whole. You certainly see that in Pagford.What is less successful is the plot, which is thin (to be charitable), and ostensibly centered around a sudden (&#34;casual&#34;) city council vacancy, but to be honest, it hardly mattered to me. This is that rare book that didn't feel especially constrained by its lack of plot. The city council vacancy was just the MacGuffin that let me drop in on this town and root around in its characters lives for a while. That was joy enough.",4,"12 28, 2013",1388188800,"[1, 1]"

I was, again, wrong.So- if you are looking for a book filled with depressingly adult actions (drugs, rape, etc), but a thematic element that is on par with maybe what an 8th grader would be able to understand, then this is the book for you.Otherwise... well...

"0316228532","A29U4Z4PBD7CNG","ikirkwood62","You can try to separate Harry Potter from this...","... but you cannot. And that's not the fault of the reader, that's the fault of the author. But let's start at the beginning.""The Casual Vacancy"", by JK Rowling, was hands down the most anticipated book of the year. How many authors do you know that say ""I'm writing a new book"" and people who don't read for fun start readying their wallets? I pre-ordered this book a long time ago (about 6 months-- right around when it was announced), and have been uber-pumped this entire time. When they released the official description, I was still excited. It sounded different and interesting and realistic. Others were skeptical.But throughout the entire build up of this book, I figured I would be able to love it, because I would be able to separate Harry Potter from TCV. I've always felt that JK Rowling is an insanely talented author, not just some woman who got lucky with a tight plot for seven books. I mean, she wrote seven freaking books, and each one was amazing. That doesn't happen by accident.In this novel, I was looking forward to the beautiful transitions between backstory and forward action, the slight humor in between the actual words, the incredibly deep themes, and well hidden ""guns"" (a la Anton Chekhov's ""the Seagull"").  That was the JK Rowling I wanted, in a fresh new setting, and I would gladly accept it without wands, despite the fact that I am of *the* Harry Potter Generation (not only that, but the 7th book came out on my 13th Birthday).I must admit, I'm dissapointed. Not in the book itself, but in the fact that JK Rowling wasn't able to set herself apart from what we've come to expect from her. This would have been a good debut for any no name author. But this is from a well-established, talented woman.The opening of this book is weak (although it begins with Death), and it flounders to get up on its feet.After Barry Fairbrother dies, he leaves a council seat open (a ""casual vacancy"") and all sorts of ""war"" starts to happen, between classes, genders, spouses, etc. The book starts off with a vivid image of Barry's death. Then, it goes to how some of the people in town react to his death. And then to some more people reacting. Oh... and then back to some of the previously mentioned people for a bit. And then back to more new characters having different reactions to Barry's death.The beginning is downright exhausting. This much is true.  New character after new Character is introduced, and it's kind of like the beginning of ""the Dark Knight Rises"" earlier this summer, when you need a strong protaganist, but you need all these characters developed for a later payoff. But while reading, its frustrating, and the scenes start to become annoying.Now, Rowling stressed this was an ""adult"" book before it was released. And i agree, this is quite an adult book. But it's such an adult book that it comes off as a little try-hard, actually. In the first 5% of the Kindle Version, there are 10-15 f words (and a c word!), an unnecesarry reference to masturbation, and even some nudity to boot (which I know isn't that bad in book form but still). Not to mention a brief sex scene, if you can even call it that. While reading, one can only send telepathic messages to Rowling urging her to ""please chill out, really, I get that this isn't for children.""I don't mind explicit material (I'm 18 for chrissake's, I can handle it), but I don't see it really fitting in in this case. It stands out awkwardly along the simplistic writing, and it is used poorly, as if you taught a 6 year old girl that you yell these words when you're angry, but you don't tell her why. There was a disconnect, because the dialogue doesn't match the prose.Speaking of which, the writing in this book is the sharp, witty stuff you've come to expect from JK. But, if you ask me, its also what ultimately spoiled this book for me. I wanted to love this book and totally separate it from Harry Potter... but the problem is, the writing style will not let you. The descriptions are long, the dialogue cartoonish (at times), and there is just too much sassy wit for it to not be hypercritical.The first section, as we go around and meet all the characters, reads like an extended Dursley Chapter from HP. Every time a new name is introduced, it's some sort of flawed Englishmen, who have no business doing what they're doing. Often, the characters are ugly, inside and out, and JK focuses on these flaws. And you keep begging for a break from this, but what comes? More characters.And that might be the biggest flaw of the book. It leaves you on your knees, eagerly anticipating a magical event, some large revelation or something. All I wanted while reading was a break from the characters, or something crazy to happen that would totally shock their world. I think that's what Barry Fairbrother's death was supposed to be... but it just didn't cut it for the reader.Admittedly, I still haven't finished the novel yet, but I think I'm far enough to know my opinion of it. I'm going to finish this, of course, but, unless there is some groundbreaking twist or something (which signs point to no), then I'm probably not going to return to it again. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it. I mean, a lot of people might read this book just to feel relevant. It's the hot topic for a week or so, so be prepared.****If my opinion changes after I finish this book (50-100 pages left), I'll come back and edit this to reflect my sentiments.",3,"10 2, 2012",1349136000,"[6, 10]"

Rowling is a different kind of book. Not only is it as far as possibly different than the HP series, it is also a book that is different from all adult novels. If you are looking for something similar to Harry Potter or a good wholesome read like the Potterdom was...put this book down and head to the teen section. This is a black comedy novel FOR ADULTS and even made me as an adult a little nervous at times. Not to put too big of a spoiler on things but there is rape, sex, scandal, child abuse, drug abuse, and lots of British jargon to hold it all together (think tracksuits) in this small town.The storyline is basically what all the petty little people in small town Pagford decide to do and who they decide to step on to get to their goals when councilman Barry Fairbrother dies, leaving an open council spot...a casual vacancy. His death impacts the fate of the addiction clinic and its inhabitants as well as those who loved and hated him.A Casual Vacancy is small town soap-opera Peyton Place meets ruthless people and motives of Trainspotting. That being said, once I committed myself to the work and got over J.K. Rowling being a dirty writer, I could not put the work down. And once I did finish the book, I was left with an overwhelming satisfaction. I was not satisfied that everything had been wrapped up in a neat little bow, nor that there was a happy ending (there's not) but rather satisfied because the work was real. It's as real as fiction gets folks. Furthermore, I realized that I loved every single one of the characters of Vacancy...even the baddies! Rowling has a way of being real with the reader and letting us know the characters as fully as one can and that makes the book worth a read in itself. If it comes to pass, I will definitely read other adult novels that J.K. Rowling writes.Even though its not what Potterfans might be craving, it might whet their appetite for something meatier while they wait for the main course.",4,"10 8, 2012",1349654400,"[3, 5]"

I, just like countless thousands of other readers was so curious about what this author would come up with after so many hugely popular Harry Potter books. This book was in a way, refreshing, and in a way disappointing. Let me explain.I knew going in after watching the news coverage on the release of this book, that it was intended for adults. I also knew that it was a...bit off the beaten path, particularly when held in comparison to her previous books. I think that is where we reviewers may be going wrong. As much as we swear we will not judge this novel off of previous books by this author, the magic and wonder of her previous series is steadfastly and stubbornly locked in our minds.I did my best to lay Harry and his magical friends to rest when I picked up ""The Casual Vacancy."" So from here on I will not mention the previous series again.What I loved about this book: This book was funny at times, sad at others and moved along at a good enough clip to keep my mind occupied. I thought the town was great, the characters were sharp and the writing itself was very good. I liked that the author told the fans what she wanted to write this time rather than beat a dying horse to death and stick with the program.I liked that the ending left you wondering certain things and yet answered the most important things. I thought the book was well edited and intelligent, regardless of the subject matter.What I didn't like: (Attempting to do this without spoilers) I really couldn't see how some of the material in this book could be considered as coming from a comedic standpoint. The opinion I got when watching the pre-release coverage for this book was that it was supposed to be tinged with comedy. Some of the issues in this book are just plain depressing and not at all what I would have considered a topic to laugh about.I found an undercurrent throughout this book that strangely, made me hate it for the same reason I loved it. I felt as though the author went to extremes trying to prove that she could write something other than young adult fiction, that in an odd way, made the writing came out a bit juvenile.I also felt that the author spent a bit too little time on description and a bit too much time pondering the macabre. Perhaps it was just me, but I came away feeling a bit dry. For me, this book was like sitting on a hilltop with your camera poised on a beautiful sky waiting for that perfect sunset. All of a sudden, your expectations are shattered when a huge cloud moves in front of the sun and ruins the shot. I expected so much for a book that was five years in the making. I did not feel this book measured up to that expectation.J.K. Rowling previously said that she would not want to talk to anyone who did not cry at the end of this book. I hope I am not the first to disappoint her, but Not a single tear did I shed. I seriously came away feeling casually vacant.To those of you who are moaning and groaning over the prices of the kindle books and leaving negative reviews...it is wingardium leviosa....NOT Wingardium Levi-o-sahhhhhhh.

Without revealing the plot or going into detail for those who may want to give it a try, I can say that at first the sheer volume of foul language in this book was disappointing.  I am not a prude, and I am not overly-sensitive to bad language, and given the right situation and company, I can swear like a sailor.  However, this book is literally ""f*ing"" this and ""c*nting"" that every other sentence.  I felt like Ms. Rowling went out of her way to show the world that this was ""a book for adults"" by making the language so foul that even the most liberal-minded person would not want even their adult children with earshot of the language in this book.  Now, I realize that Ms. Rowling may have been attempting to accurately depict her characters, but I really felt the use of bad language was more than gratuitous, and that it was filler for lack of more plot or character development.  Does all of lower class England curse non-stop? My second largest problem with the book was that ALL of the characters were extremely difficult to like.

"0316228532","A2TYKFDVH1UW2C","Jacquelyn M. Sylvan","Sometimes, Different Is Good!","Okay, so...okay.I know this has been stated time and time again, but I feel the need to reiterate it. This book is not Harry Potter. There are no happy endings here, so if you're looking for a book that will bring you joy and a sense of happiness and completion, look elsewhere. The Casual Vacancy is not that book.It's an uncomfortable book to read. At first, the discomfort comes from hearing JK Rowling's distinctive voice in your head, narrating the foulest language and the dirtiest, most vile thoughts you can imagine. It's a bit like hearing a five-year-old read aloud from Fifty Shades. But as you go deeper, the discomfort comes from how Rowling gets inside the heads of the characters, in a way that reaches inside you and puts its finger on the parts of yourself you're most ashamed of.I'm incredibly impressed by that last part. The cast of The Casual Vacancy is immensely diverse, and yet Rowling seems to know them as intimately as she knows herself. She pulls no punches, and that's why it works. If she'd tried to soften it the smallest bit, the book would have failed miserably. But because Rowling was unflinchingly, tragically honest...it succeeded brilliantly.",5,"11 23, 2012",1353628800,"[1, 1]"
"0316228532","A3UDYY6L2NH3JS","Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","Too dark to be somber, too sinister to be caustic","The authoress tried herself in the social drama with a good sprinkling of politics. But how can you be better than Ruth Rendell in that line?The book is a very close and inside description of the people living in a small town called Pagford under the domination of a bigger city called Yardil. It is plainly ugly and there is not one character that can save the place. They are all mean, self-centered, selfish, erratic and unpredictable at least in any nice thing they could do for others.We have to wait for the very last pages for one character to save the day, a character who had been bullied because she was of Asian origin and who had attempted suicide many times and commits one of the cybercrimes we are going to speak of later. And yet she will end up as the only one who will be able to go beyond all limits and create some love in a trashcan of a village.But the main characteristic of the novel is that it has to be more psychological than centering on action because there is so little action, just individual acts that aim at making a profit or hurting someone. That gives to the novel a very slow rhythm and that&#8217;s a shame because it could have been more dynamic if slightly shorter. We finally have the proper rhythm in the last twenty pages, but we have been obliged to read 540 pages to reach that climactic climax of intense action.The best part is the use of a message board as a weapon bringing up the Ghost of a recently dead parish councilor. Social melodrama in the age of the Internet and social networks! Marvelous! We know everything about it and even on decent sites you can always find someone who calls you rubbish or worse, who spreads information about you with the intention of hurting you. I have even seen a chap publishing an old (about six months hence not up-to-date) CV of mine in a comment on a review I had posted on a serious site about a compilation of &#8220;jazzy&#8221; music from Munich. And he did that in order &#8211; and that was well expressed in full clear language &#8211; to denounce my vanity and hurt me of course, as if you could hurt someone who expresses what he thinks and refuses to caress any audience the way it pleases and excites them. This is the weapon of the cowards since you cannot know who is behind the persona who is attacking you.So you have to overlook such things. But in a small community, when the people attacked are the candidates in a by-election it becomes a rumor, gossip, political innuendo and so on, and you can be sure it will hurt. Unluckily I have not found a real identification of the author of the last post of this sort. And we know the Stuart who confesses his virtual cybercrime only wrote one of the first three messages. So the mystery of the fourth one is full and complete.The ugly social segregation against the poor, illiterate, unemployed and unemployable, junkies and claimants is not even exposed really because it is done in such a way that there is not one of the people from that abandoned social group that can really save the day. The only one who could have done it is systematically shown with very negative traits and intentions. And her mother is a pure monster and the two of them, two women as you may have understood &#8211; please do not say this is sexist, today&#8217;s drugged pig is tomorrow&#8217;s processed and over-fried bacon for the barking dogs of the establishment &#8211; will sacrifice a 3 year old boy on the altar of their derelict corrugated addiction, one, the mother, to heroin and the other, the daughter, to plot-encumbered escapismToo bad again this novel was not 350 pages.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",3,"11 9, 2013",1383955200,"[0, 1]"

"0316228532","A3F3B6HY9RJI04","James Duckett","I Wanted To Love This","I picked up The Casual Vacancy because of my love for J.K. Rowling's previous books. This is not my normal genre of reading choice, but I thought good writing would make it enjoyable. I know this is not a MG or YA Fantasy, and I'm not going to knock it stars because it isn't.The problem with this book is that it doesn't have the magic I came to expect from her. No, not the wizarding magic from a wand, but the magic of writing moving words to change hearts and inspire minds. It wasn't the language or adult subject matter, which I've heard was a turnoff to several potential readers, but it was the characters.Actually, I quite enjoyed the characters from the first chapter of the book. They seemed real to me and the story started off gripping. But then the book introduced a ton of characters and it takes a while to see how they all interconnect with each other. In fact, she would spend so much time introducing characters that by the time you got back to ones she had already introduced I had trouble remembering much about that person. By the middle of the novel I started catching on, seeing how different each character was, what their goals were, and how they all related to each other in the story.In the meantime, I didn't like how nobody was happy. Yes, I know that happy characters don't make for a compelling story, but these characters were all extremely gloomy and depressed. I noticed, while reading this book, that I started feeling depressed as well. There was very little that I found uplifting in this book.Once I muscled through the introduction of characters things started happening. Yeah, that's right; things don't really start rolling until about two-thirds of the way into the book. At that point the story does work its way to a pretty climatic and emotional ending. No, I didn't cry or anything, but I did feel the pain I would have felt if such events had happened in my own community.Ultimately, the ending didn't justify the journey it took to get there. If this were anybody else I would have given up reading this book in frustration long before the halfway mark. But because of the magic she has worked in me before, I gave her the benefit of a doubt. I think I'm being generous giving this three stars. It isn't because this didn't measure up to Harry Potter, but this just didn't measure up to good writing.",3,"10 10, 2012",1349827200,"[21, 24]"

"0316228532","A3A9UCRADPMCT8","James Horlan","Hogwarts Nowhere to Be Found","This is probably the best Maeve Binchy novel since Circle of Friends......wait, what?  It's Jo Rowling?  Oh right.  You sure?But seriously, this is an R-rated Maeve Binchy novel, only without a main protagonist or any truly likeable characters.  So of course I was riveted, go figure.The Casual Vacancy's reason for being is the death of Barry Fairbrother, local councillor in the town of Pagford and basic nice guy who cared about people.  We see him briefly, and he sticks around long enough to make a good impression, making his 'end' a bit shocking (I purposefully knew nothing about the plot before opening the book).  His death creates a 'casual vacancy', meaning that his seat needs to be filled.  At stake, potentially, is the lease of the local drug clinic, and the boundary relocation of the local 'hard neighborhood'/slum The Fields.  Not national news of course, but the local folk take it extremely seriously.We meet the three candidates:  Miles Mollison, son of the council chair and presumed front-runner......Simon Price, aloof loner and abusive husband/father.....Cubby Wall, school deputy headmaster and friend of Barry's.  They aren't the main characters though, no one is really, and there must be at least a dozen other POV characters throughout the book.  Two teenagers are slightly moved more to the front than the others:  Andrew Price, shy and intimidated by his overbearing father Simon, but who winds up in a lot of scenes that should have nothing to do with him.  He has a basic decency about him, though he finds it difficult to let it show.  The other is Krystal Weedon, a 16 year old denizen of The Fields who smokes hard, talks and fights even harder, and only really cares about her 3 year old brother Robbie, and wants him better raised than she was (by her smack addicted mother, the worst piece of work in a novel full of them).  I got the feeling early on that Krystal is Jo's favorite of the bunch, and like Andrew she figured in a lot of plotlines that otherwise you wouldn't expect.What did I like about it?  I'm a bit ashamed to say that I enjoyed the vileness of the characters, they kept me entertained as I wondered what they would do next, it would invariably be something bad to one of the others.  I read the novel during breaks at work, and I found myself, when I should have been concentrating fully on work, wondering what these people would be up to next.  The election was nicely done, and thankfully not over dwelled upon.  The story moved along, and I wouldn't have minded an extra 200 pages in it, not one bit.What's not to like?  Well the vileness frankly.  I could barely root for Andrew, and he was the nicest of the men, none of whom come off that well.  The women were done a little nicer (not better, nicer), but there was always one huge quality in each of them that made you want to scream at them.  Also, while I get why Jo liked Krystal.....well I didn't, and she was so obtuse about things, or willfully stubborn in a bad way, that I didn't mind when bad things happened to her as much as some of the other characters.There's not going to be a sequel to this novel, the reviews are shredding it just hard enough to guarantee that I think, but seeds are laid that allow Jo to revisit these characters if she wants to.  I kind of hope she does too.  I wouldn't want to read this kind of novel every week, I'd want to start cutting myself like one of the characters does, but she did it very well.  Of course it's not as good as Harry Potter was, though that wasn't a given, but nobody really expected it to be.  I just hope that whatever she does next, it won't take five years for her to do it.

The reviews I've read so far speak to the dissonance Harry Potter fans feel when they encounter a novel that echoes (in my estimation) those of P. D. James.  James's characters are seldom likeable, but James strives for truth-telling:  most people, in life as in her novels, are not pleasant people.  The same is true of Rowling's new novel:  telling the truth about one's characters is what Rowling's novel is about.  It's not sweet reading.  But it has the punch of truth:  the truth, as Rowling sees it, is not pretty.  If you want pretty and nice, stick to her novels for children;  if you want to understand human nature, read The Casual Vacancy.

However, like everything that looks perfect, secrets run rampant through Pagford's streets, waiting for the moment to be set free.That moment arrives in the death of Barry Fairbrother. After suffering an aneurism on the night of his wedding anniversary, the town of Pagford becomes torn. With Barry's death, a Casual Vacancy arises, a seat left vacant on the Parish Council due to death.There are a few hopefuls vying for the coveted seat: Howard Mollison wants his son Miles to take the seat so that Miles can help Howard rid Pagford of The Fields, a rundown part of town home to a methadone clinic. Howard is thrilled at Barry's death as Howard may finally rid Pagford of an eyesore. Miles' wife Samantha, however, is less than thrilled and begins to fantasize about much younger boys.Collin Wall, Deputy Head minister of the local high school, also wants to run for the vacant seat. As Barry's former best friend, Collin thinks Barry would have wanted him to carry on his work, bringing The Fields and Pagford together, instead of tearing them apart.Tessa Wall, who is the school guidance counselor, is more concerned over the antics of their son Stuart ""Fats"" and his association with Krystal Weedon and the mental state of her husband if he actually wins the seat; Collin hides a secret that could ruin him if exposed.Simon Price also wants to run, despite having isolated himself from the community. His wife, Ruth, approves of him running because she is used to agreeing. It is the only way to keep him from getting angry. Often abusive to his two sons, Andrew ""Arf"" and Paul, taking in stolen goods and stealing from his place of work, Andrew wonders what would happen to his father if his secrets got out.Even those not hoping to fill the casual vacancy are affected by Barry Fairbrother's death: Parminder, who harbors secret feelings of her own, lavishes attention on one daughter while degrading her other daughter Sukhvinder who cuts herself to release the pain. Kay, a social worker who has just been assigned to help Terri Weedon and her children Krystal and Robbie as their mother struggles with heroin addiction.There's also Gaia, Kay's daughter, who is bereft at leaving London because her mother followed her noncommittal boyfriend Gavin Wall to Pagford. Gavin, who knows he never should have let his relationship with Kay go so far is only concerned with ending the relationship and the love he holds close for another woman. Let's not forget Shirley Mollison, Howard's wife, who has her own secret agenda or Maureen, Howard's business partner, who does whatever Howard says; Or what about Mary Fairbrother who had grown to dislike her husband and his growing attachment to Krystal Weedon?Pagford is a picture perfect little town. Like anything that looks perfect, there is shadow underneath. What would happen if that shadow were exposed? What if the secrets of those in town were exposed, out in public? Would Pagford hold itself together, or would cracks begin to appear in its postcard image?Before the Casual Vacancy is filled, the town of Pagford will find out and no one will be the same...I wasn't expecting to like The Casual Vacancy, much less love it. This has nothing to do with the fact that it's not the next Harry Potter book. I knew going into The Casual Vacancy to have no expectations because it was decidedly not Harry Potter. Rowling's first book for adults couldn't be more different than that other fictional world she created, but a small town political novel just didn't sound thrilling to me.There was also the fact that, from the first page, I knew that The Casual Vacancy wasn't going to be a quick read. The tone of the writing is completely different and I knew it would not feature the wicked fast plot of the Harry Potter novels. However, I read on anyways, knowing that Rowling is a good writer and hoping for a good story.Well, I was wrong. J K Rowling is an incredible writer and in The Casual Vacancy she had penned an amazing novel with an amazing story. The Casual Vacancy actually has very little to do with the politics surrounding the title. Instead, it is really a study of the people who live in Pagford and the whims of human nature.I suspect that the title of J K Rowling's new novel is really a play on words. A Casual Vacancy is a situation in which a political assembly's seat is declared vacant through resignation, disqualification or death. However, due to the nature of all of Pagford being involved and the possibility of an election that has split the town and those that want the vacant seat for their own ends, there is nothing casual about this vacancy.As I read, I was reminded of many different authors. If I had to compare it to anything (although Rowling has written it so well that The Casual Vacancy is really incomparable), I would say it's a mix of Charles Dickens, Maeve Binchy, Minette Walters and Meg Rosoff. The Casual Vacancy is bleak, gut wrenching, horrifying, frightening but also joyful and surprisingly funny. It's a book that defies genres and boundaries.Rowling's strength as a writer has never been more noticeable than with The Casual Vacancy. Her characters are so well drawn that you identify with each and every one of them and the further you read, the more you become involved in their lives. Multiple storylines criss cross and meet up with each other and it takes a writer of the highest caliber to keep all of the intersecting characters and storylines straight and still tell an amazing story. Surprisingly, the young adult characters in this novel (Andrew, Stuart, Gaia, Shukvinder, Krystal) play a larger role than I thought possible in a ""political novel"". Rowling's adult characters are just as well drawn and as you watch all of their lives intersect, you wonder how Rowling can possibly tie everything together in the end. Thankfully, she does it with grace and style and an ending I never, ever saw coming.Make no mistake, though, this is an adult novel. In the pages of The Casual Vacancy, you'll find drugs and drug use, sex, racism, prejudice, rape, theft, poverty, cutting and self-abuse. However, you will also find laughter, humour, joy, determination and hope. It is a novel less about politics than it is about the people who make up a community.The Casual Vacancy is beautifully written and incredibly told. It is not a novel for the faint of heart, but is also a novel so full of heart that the characters within it will stay with me for the rest of my life. It made me laugh out loud, made me cry in public, had me rooting for some characters and loving to hate others.It is a book you do not merely read; instead, you live inside of it until the last turn of the page and beyond.",5,"10 3, 2012",1349222400,"[14, 25]"

I sometimes refer to her as ""Jo"" and I was so excited that she was writing a new book. In my mind, the worst case scenario was that it would be a total flop and she would go back to writing Harry Potter novels.From the start, I was hooked. Casual Vacancy was as un-Potterish as it is possible to be. J.K. Rowling writes characters that swear like sailors and deal with bus ride erections. WHAT?

This is not a happy romp through an idyllic town but rather a town masking the war brewing underneath the surface. No, not Voldemort, this war is about ideals, money, and hidden desires. In a sense, this book is about the Dursley's life, if Harry Potter did not exist. In fact, you might think Dudley Dursley is a much sweeter kid than Fats, one of the major players in Casual Vacancy.If you can muddle through how quickly Jo switches character point of view, sometimes mid-paragraph, and begin to make sense of her writing style, if you can find it in your heart to root for some of these tragic, broken people, than you will read a book that takes you on the emotional ride of your life.I have a habit of reading some sad books, so this was totally up my alley. If Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire broke your heart, then this book might be a little too intense for you.If you wanted to know what was really going on in some of those empty classrooms in Hogwarts, or how the Dursley's fit in with normal society, and enjoy books that are not action/adventure/mystery but a bit of a slow build, then you'll love it.",4,"12 3, 2012",1354492800,"[1, 2]"

"0316228532","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","Jane Easterly","A brilliant and powerful novel that is incredibly difficult to read","Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's new adult book The Casual Vacancy is a brilliant and powerful novel that is incredibly difficult to read. Rowling proves in this book what a skillful writer she is. She is able to create characters so complex, so multi-faceted, that it's hard to remember they aren't real.Contrary to what the publisher promised in its promotional materials, The Casual Vacancy is not a ""black comedy."" It is a grim, honest, realistic slice of life, populated by troubled, deep, and interesting people. There are a lot of important characters in The Casual Vacancy. It takes determination and patience to learn about each one and keep them straight.Despite the grim and depressing circumstances outlined for so many of the characters, I could feel myself drawn into the world of Pagford, the small town in England that serves as the book's setting. It didn't seem that different in many ways from the city in which I live. The themes are relevant to life in the United States as well as England. Some of the people of Pagford resent the people who live in a place referred to as the Fields. It lies between Pagford and the larger city of Yarvil. Yarvil pays for the provision of many services to the Fields, but Pagford bears part of the burden. To their dismay, this includes allowing children of the Fields to attend their school, which they feared ""would be overrun and swamped by the offspring of scroungers, addicts, and mothers whose children had all been fathered by different men.""Some of the arguments are depressingly familiar. At one point two characters are discussing whether the addiction clinic does any good, and the subject turns to ""principles.""""Yes, well, principles are sometimes the problem, if you ask me,"" said Miles. ""Often what's needed is a bit of common sense.""""Which is the name people usually give to their prejudices,"" rejoined Kat.Rowling has a great talent for making her readers care for the characters she creates. In this novel, there is no main character. Instead, we are inside the heads of many people through a narrator. Rowling will introduce a character in such a way as to provoke a negative reaction, and then let us see the character's life from a different standpoint and stir up great sympathy. She first introduces a promiscuous, ignorant, and belligerent girl through the eyes of a teenaged boy and a school administrator; later we see the girl skipping school to clean up her filthy home in desperate hopes of persuading a social worker not to take her little brother from her addict mother. Another teenaged girl is being bullied, and at one point I was reluctant to read ahead because I was afraid the bully would not be the obvious candidate but another character, and I really did not want that other character to be a bully.The plot is relatively straightforward, but it moves steadily toward a terrific and terrible climax. Even though I wasn't able to predict what was coming, I felt a mounting sense of dread over the last fifth of the book.I am not easily moved to tears, but I cried at the end of The Casual Vacancy. I keep thinking about the events in the book and how they could have been changed for the better through action by some of the characters, and I marvel at how I feel real grief. I wonder how the characters are getting on; then I have to remind myself that they aren't real people. In the end, my sadness is not only for the unfortunate characters in the book but for the many real people whose lives are just as unfortunate. I'm guessing that was one of Rowling's objectives.I will not say that I enjoyed this complex and heartbreaking book. It's too grim and real. But I am very glad that I read it, and I highly recommend The Casual Vacancy to any reader who likes realistic fiction, exceptionally well-drawn characters, and excellent writing.",5,"10 17, 2012",1350432000,"[3, 4]"
"0316228532","A1CNQTCRQ35IMM","Jane","Most of the book is petty, unpleasant people hurting others.  The ending is sad and depressing.","During the first half of the book I took a lot of notes, more than normal.  I didn't know who was going to be important.  It turned out almost everyone was important, so I needed those notes.  There were nine households with parents and children to keep track of and additional characters as well.  By the middle of the book I was wondering when are things going to start getting good?  Later in the book I was impatient for it to be over.  The last thirty pages were the best, when interesting things happened to two characters.  One stood up against obstacles and made a difference.  One saw beneficial changes in her circumstances.  But for all the other characters, things just continued as before.  There were a few minor changes, but nothing that grabbed me.Most of the book, the first 475 pages, is about selfish, petty, lying, cheating, unpleasant people doing mean things to others.  Some of them are incompetent.  Some refuse to see the truth and cover it up.  Some physically or mentally abuse their children and spouse.  There was not a single good marriage in the bunch.  There was no one to root for (until the very end) when a tragedy happens to someone you care about.  A lot of people were being hurt.  It was not entertaining.The story is set in a village called Pagford which is run by a 16-member council.  One council member dies.  An election will be held to replace him.  We learn about the candidates.  The main political issue is The Fields, a low-income housing area located just outside of the village.  Some council members want to stop paying for social and other services.  Other members want to continue supporting The Fields.One of the stories is 16-year-old Krystal and her and 3-year-old-brother Robbie living with their drug-addict-mother Terri in The Fields.  It's depressing and tearful to see how they live and suffer.I think the author's purpose (at the end) was to have readers care about and do something to help those less fortunate, especially children who live in poverty.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person.  Story length: 503 pages.  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.  Sexual language: none.  Number of sex scenes: about 8, including one rape.

I guess it is too much to expect, but I am curious how people who didn't like this book would have felt if it was written by someone else. Clearly they have nothing in common and there should be no comparison. In any case, I really liked this book. I want to say I loved it, but I had a few issues, so I won't go all '5 Stars' but it's close. In the beginning, I did have trouble keeping the characters straight but by the end of the book, it was no longer an issue. Maybe it's because I live in a small town that I found the entire story completely believable. The political alliances and back room shennanigans with regards to local elections is intense to say the least. I loved the way all these lives intertwined, even though the people themselves don't realize it. I couldn't help but remember the line from ""It's A Wonderful Life"": ""One man's life touches so many others."" My one complaint is that I wish there was more closure on some characters storylines. But then again, maybe that's why she left it that way - life goes on. And so it will in Pagford and The Fields.",4,"11 16, 2012",1353024000,"[1, 1]"

However, it was given to me recently as a gift and I was thrilled to read in Rolling's pioneer effort. As a writer, I like to support other authors, even when I am not sure about the book at first. The first few pages with too many characters thrown at the reader confused me. I had to refer back and forth time and time again and went on ahead. By page 149, I thought good heavens, when is a PLOT going to happen. Rolling's talent is definitely with character development and I came to know them well and pictured them in my mind. The plot finally did unravel and at a fast speed, and the book was worth hanging on with. I always like to see a moral angle in a book and I was not disappointed. I certainly applaud Rolling for stepping into new territory and would support her in anything she does as many of us do. This book? Glad I read it, I would be very hesitant to recommend it without saying to other readers know that in my view, it's a long read with paydirt coming way down the line. Also, my largest objection is the profanity from seemingly EVERY character had; it was not necessary. It got tiresome and offensive, frankly. I would love to sit down with Rolling or hear from her as to why she made everyone so profanity speaking, it really wasn't necessary.

I spent way too much time trying to keep up with the characters as theyseemed to come from every direction. I never felt much care or concern for any of the characters (Miles, Shirley, Mary, Samantha, Kay,Krystal, etc...) and not caring much about them meant I just lost interest in the book. What was the message? I am still not sure asthe book starts off interestingly enough as Barry Fairbrother suddenly dies at a country club on his anniverary. I figured that meantthere would be all types of political backstabbing as others in the small town of Pagford would then fight for his spot.Instead, I spent the time reading the book trying to figure out if JK Rowling was writing a book about the economic problems of Englandor the social problems or real estate issues (maybe all of that?). I just know I was so disappointed in the book. I also got real tiredof the ""F"" word that seemed to be on the tip of her pencil for every page. Okay, I get it. The poor people in the book like that word.I get it. Enough. It was an example to me that Rowling wanted to distance herself from her Harry Potter books (and great books at that!)but it was like reading a social work assessment at times (read the book to learn about the Weedon family as my example) and too muchof ""over the top"" out of control deviant behavior from too many people.I just do not understand the purpose behind this book. What was the message? Who knows. Who cares. I read the book and now I just feelthat JK Rowling swung and missed big time on her first ""adult"" novel.

The editors should have  prevented this, especially for such a high profile writer.That being said, I really liked the book.  Having skimmed the reviews, I really think some reviewers are unaccustomed to the specific literary genre Rowling used.  Casual Vacancy reminds me of works by writers like Anne Tyler, Maeve Binchy, and Rosamund Pilcher.  They, too, explored the minds of rather ordinary people and their relationships.  Anyone unaccustomed to this genre may find reading such a book somewhat unsettling.  Readers often are forced to see elements of themselves in story characters with whom they may not want to identify.  This can be somewhat unnerving if you are not used to it.  I suspect that is what brought about some of the angriest reviews.  If you are looking for something self-affirming this is not a genre for you. If you are looking for self awareness and incite, you are more likely to appreciate what Rowling was trying to do. I remember years ago reading The Shell Seekers by Rosamund Piltcher and finding elements of myself in a character I found  quite unappealing.It was disturbing. The author intended to  disturb.

The Harry Potter series is when the planets align: a great author and a great story that kept on getting better and better. ""Harry Potter"" was fantastical escapism; ""The Casual Vacancy"" is relentless realism--and at times laughable absurdity. Now, you must understand I'm not judging ""Vacancy"" based on her previous success; I'm judging Vacancy based on what it is.Now, I dislike teen fiction largely; I like J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, and I like Clive Barker's Abarat series. That's it. So, trust me, when I heard that J.K. Rowling was FINALLY going to do an adult novel, I was PUMPED up, because I'm a reader of many genres of many eras and many authors. But, I was left feeling a little underwhelmed.THE CASUAL VACANCY:What I did like about the book was that J.K. Rowling, as a writer (as opposed to a storyteller), did take a lot of risks with style; I LIKE THAT. That's why Stephen King is my favorite author; for instance, J.K. Rowling, on occasion, will have a couple paragraphs between parentheses (truthfully the effect of the literary device may be ""cool"" coming from Rowling, but normally I wasn't impressed by the content of her style--in fact, sometimes it was pointless for her to even try. But I did respect her daringness.)On the flipside of liking her style, she has gotten into a weird habit with colons: you see what I did there? She does this a lot. The habit started sometime after ""The Half Blood Prince"" and before ""The Deathly Hallows."" It's a little jarring sometimes because she should use a semi-colon instead of a colon; it makes more sense that way, but I think she just got so rich and powerful nobody will raise their voice and say, ""Rowling, I don't get what you're doing with the overuse of colons."" But that's only a small gripe; it didn't affect ""The Deathly Hallows.""The story does end up being very, very touching at the end of the book; but it takes a very, very long time for the multitude of storylines to gain momentum and meet up at appropriate parts. This book, in a way, is like a lot of British films: Death at a Funeral, Intermission, Trainspotting, Love Actually, etc. There are tons of small storylines that intermingle. What binds all the characters in this book? A death of a citizen in a small town: it happened in the prologue and from there on, J.K. examines their behaviors and what happens next.IN CONCLUSION:""The Casual Vacancy"" is stuck in between an awkward spot. You've got the Harry Potter fans who either a) jump on the bandwagon and are bitterly disappointed (and for good reason, mind you), or b) don't read the book,  because they're waiting to hear what other people have to say (which will be largely negative). The book is too slow-paced for young readers who only read flavor of the month books (like this book), and therefore, they'll buy it, get bored, stop reading; the book is too raunchy for ""casual"" readers like my mom or my dad (and with all the cussing, even if they did pick up the book, my mom wouldn't finish it). If you want a touching book which makes you feel something at the end, that's why there's Mitch Albom  (he's at least smart enough to make his books so short that even if you do grow bored, you could finish it relatively quick). I'm not opposed to books that are merely written to get an emotional reaction from the reader, even if the entire book is boring--""On The Beach"" by Nevil Shute, case and point: I love that book. But ""On The Beach"" at least had a momentum from the very beginning.""The Casual Vacancy"" is rolling up hill until about the midway point. But, unlike some books where it feels like a rollercoaster is going up, up, up and down, in which the author is pushing you up, up, and up; ""The Casual Vacancy"" is different in the sense that the reader is doing all the pushing, thinking to themselves, ""Nothing is happening yet, I still don't know what the point of the book is, it's boring but something's going to happen, I know it; I have faith in Rowling, faith in Rowling, faith in . . ."" That is literally the mentality I had while reading the book. It was exhausting! And I, on occasional, really like slow books (""On The Beach""), but there needs to be more payoffs throughout the book.Also, trust me when I say that I'm not holding Harry Potter on such a high pedestal that I can't forgive her writing a boring, adult novel; I'm one of those people who like Linkin Park when they changed their genre, so I am a very generous fan of the things I am a fan of--and I considered myself a Rowling fan (but I now realize that I was just* a Harry Potter fan, which is sad).  Sometimes artists have to change. J.K. Rowling clearly couldn't make another Harry Potter-esque series, so she wrote ""The Casual Vacancy""--but it all seems a little too much of a forced attempt to escape Harry Potter.",3,"09 30, 2012",1348963200,"[24, 31]"

"0316228532","A1I70BA0VXYNKT","Jennifer A. Slater","My kids got the best of her...","The Harry Potter series was a once in a lifetime experience, one that will probably continue as long as there are children who continually reach the age where they can read a book of that size, and as long as there are adults who realize they never experienced it.  I had to buy 3 copies of each of the 7 books in that series, one for each of my children, because they couldn't wait to dive back into the magic they knew they were about to experience.  After the first book came out, the remaining six found me camped out in a lawn chair and a sleeping bag with my kids waiting for Target to open their doors so we could race inside and grab the next installment.  Even as an adult these books blew me away with the depth and unfathomable imagination that Ms. Rowling possesses.  Which is why, when I heard she had authored a book for grown-ups, I absolutely could not wait.  I was now going to be able to experience the can't-put-it-down ride that children across the world had been enjoying for years.  I'm telling you all this because this fierce expectation I had for an adult version of Ms. Rowling's talent may be part of the reason why I was so disappointed with The Casual Vacancy.  Or at least that's what I told myself as I was trying to come up with a reason to keep reading.  Certainly, I thought, it had to get better.  But sadly, it did not.  The first impression I had of The Casual Vacancy was that it seemed to be a poor imitation of Mauve Binchey's classic style, a collection of different characters that eventually came together at the end of an intricate but interesting story.  Unfortunately, the difference between these two authors is that Ms. Binchey's characters were fascinating, fun to get to know (even if they were evil) and her stories were often punctuated with a dry and unexpected sense of humor.  Totally delightful.  The characters in The Casual Vacancy were never really described in depth, possibly because by page 112 there were already 27 main characters.  I spent so much time flipping back and forth trying to remember who everyone was, who they were related to, and what their emotional handicap was, that I finally created a cheat-sheet of names.  However, by that point, I realized I had already lost interest in the entire book.  If you're a fast reader and can get through this novel fairly quickly I say go for it, if for no other reason than to see what Ms. Rowling has created.  But I highly recommend that as you start reading, you stick a post-it at the front of the book and jot down a brief description of each character as they are introduced, or feel free to print off a copy of what I typed up for my daughter, which I added as a hidden document entitled ""Roadmap"" on my webpage.  I pray that Ms. Rowling's feelings aren't hurt by the reviews this book has received, she is so obviously a kind and sensitive person, and so incredibly gifted.  And I truly hope she publishes another adult novel because I still adore her as a writer and a storyteller and would be the first in line to buy a copy.",2,"10 26, 2012",1351209600,"[2, 4]"

Barry's death results in a casual vacancy on the Pagford Parish Council, and a number of people are keen to fill it. There are those who want to carry on Barry's work, and those who want to put a stop to what he was trying to achieve. Like most small towns, Pagford has its politics and its secrets.The Parish Council is split over whether Pagford will retain responsibility for the council housing estate known as `the Fields' which is on land within the parish of Pagford, or hand responsibility to the bigger district council of Yarvil. Barry wanted to keep the Fields, and was campaigning to that end when he died. Others, led by Howard Mollison, would be only too happy to rid themselves of responsibility for the inhabitants of the Field, and would be delighted if their children were not able to attend Pagford's local school. And if the methadone clinic at the Bellchapel Clinic closes, many locals would be delighted.There's a large cast of characters in this novel: flawed adults and awkward teenagers get along (or don't) as competition heats up for election to the casual vacancy. Out in the Fields, the main focus is on the sad and squalid lives of the drug addicted Terri Weedon, and her children Krystal and Robbie. Even the good people (with the possible exception of the now dead Barry Fairbrother) are frequently self-absorbed, have their flaws and their secrets. There is no magic in this novel, just a lot of depressingly gritty reality. Can people be saved from the consequences of their own actions? Can the actions of others be mitigated? And who will be elected to the casual vacancy? Will people take care of each other? Are there any heroes?While I found this an easy novel to read, it has left me with very mixed feelings. Sadness and optimism competed for primacy. Even though I didn't like some aspects of the novel, as a whole it works. The teenagers are especially well drawn: their different concerns and expectations; their aspirations, struggles and realities are what brought the novel to life for me. Most of the adults are awful - at least some of the time - but there's hope, by the end for some. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

She had phenomenal success and garnered millions of fans worldwide with her wonderful Harry Potter series. (And, I might add, she had the courage and willingness to end it after seven books instead of going on and on like some authors and ruining a perfectly good series.) So now, when she dares to write a completely different kind of book (a Muggle book about Muggles doing Muggle stuff), I don't think she's getting a fair shake because it is almost impossible to read this book without thinking of the Harry Potter books. As HP fans will quickly realize, this is nothing like the Harry Potter books. (I think my friend said it best when she said ""it's a book about the Dursleys."" If Harold, Shirley and  Miles Mollison couldn't pass for Vernon, Petunia and Dudley Dursley, I'll eat my hat.) So let's forget Harry Potter and talk about this book.The book starts with the death of Barry Fairbrother (which brings about a ""casual vacancy"" on the parish council). The rest of the book focuses on the fallout from Barry's death and the maneuverings to fill his vacant seat. Moving from character to character (and there are lots of characters), Rowling takes us into the hearts and minds of the various citizens of Pagford--from its teenagers (Crystal, Fats, Sukhvinder, and Andrew) to its grown-ups (Miles, Samantha, Kay, Gavin, Tessa, Harold, Shirley, Parminder). The plot is relatively simple (how will the vacancy on the parish council be filled?) yet also intricate and complex. Every little thing that happens builds on something else, and, at the end, Rowling weaves all the pieces together masterfully. It isn't a happy, fun or uplifting book. It is set squarely in a world where things don't always work out, people fail each other, and relationships aren't always satisfying. But, for all the misery and anger and cruelty in the book, I saw moments of hope and forgiveness and growth. Personally, I liked the  book and was never bored by it. I could see why people who read this book solely because of their love of Harry Potter might be intensely disappointed. It is nothing like the HP books, but it is a good read on its own merits.

RowlingWith nearly 4,000 reviews on Amazon, and 15,000 reviews on Goodreads, I won't bore you with a summary of what the book is about.I bought The Casual Vacancy for my wife when it came out. My daughter LOVES the Harry Potter series and is on her 3rd journey through that series of books right now and I was very interested in what her first ""adult"" book would be like.That's probably the first, and most important, thing: this book is for adults. I'm not prudish about life, and I'm completely open to literature of all sorts...from Dickens to Bret Easton Ellis to any Oprah Book Club selection, I will read it.But there is periodic content in this book that would rob a child of innocence that they should be allowed to keep until they become adults. My advice...don't let anyone under 18 near it. But that decision is yours as a parent...it's only my opinion, and you know what they say about opinions and such.The book was okay. The topics didn't appeal to me, but the writing was decent, good in parts, but nothing really reached out and grabbed me about it. The main topics were sex, drugs, and a variety of struggling relationships. Some characters were VERY unbelievable to me.I started reading the book earlier than I thought I would because my wife didn't finish it. She's less tolerant of the edgy topics.I think 3 stars is fair. I don't believe in insulting authors and/or their writing...it's like insulting a mother or father for their parenting style...I think it indicates poor character to do attack and insult an author or their writing.  Authors spend months and years creating their babies, their books, and they deserve credit for their effort. I think all we, as readers, can legitimately do is say that a book wasn't for us.And so: this book was okay, but it wasn't for me. Maybe it's for you.Cheers!",3,"06 12, 2013",1370995200,"[3, 3]"

""Books: A true story""","Quite frankly the characters are boring","Before I start my review, I want to make it clear that I only read 25 pages of this book (and it took me 5 days to even get that far because it wasn't keeping my interest). I also want to make it clear that in my life I have not finished about 6 books and this is one of them.The book starts off with a death at the beginning. Then we get to see a lot of the characters reacting to this death in very different ways which could be interesting, I guess.  It does take a long time for the news to even spread.  Quite frankly the characters are boring, vanilla and not all that original. There is no plot to speak of. If there is no interesting plot or unique characters, what is supposed to keep me reading this book? I know - it says J.K. Rowling on the cover. I think that does this book a huge disservice. J.K. Rowling is not even her real name. Mrs. Rowling does not have a middle name in real life. I feel like the only reason the publisher put the same pen name that graces the Harry Potter books on this book is so people like me who LOVE Harry Potter will buy it. They are different genres - they NEED different pen names. But that's just my small opinion. I'm having a hard time reconciling the person who wrote the fun, quirky, complex and immensely entertaining children's book with the person who wrote this very adult book. They don't even seem like the same person to me. I wrote as an update while reading this that this book is kind of ruining Harry Potter for me. If I finished this book, I might not look at Harry Potter the same again.I tried to plow through the zero plot and boring characters, but I found myself not enjoying the writing, either.  The writing wasn't bad, but I didn't find it immensely interesting either. I heard this was supposed to be funny. I guess I didn't get far enough to see the funny parts. But there are characters who are married named Barry and Mary. Maybe that was supposed to be funny?  Overall, this book was just not for me.  J.K. Rowling rocks and I will love her forever.  Whatever else she writes, I will read.  Sadly, I just had to skip this one. The massive amounts of vulgarity and constant talk of sex was a huge turn-off for me.",1,"10 15, 2012",1350259200,"[4, 11]"

The audio book runs nearly 18 hours, so it occupied me for several weeks during my daily commute.The premise is quite simple: The village of Pagford is left with a &#34;casual vacancy&#34; upon the untimely death of city councilman Barry Fairbrother in his early 40's. We get to know many of the villagers via the author's omniscient point of view. The variety of characters probably represents a typical community - couples at war with each other and with their children; people having affairs; people disappointed in their careers, people who have painful secrets and dangerous addictions. Unfortunately, most of the characters don't inspire a lot of empathy, except for Krystal, teenaged daughter of a heroin addict. Krystal is trying to keep their family together in spite of the bad choices of her mother.The plot really sags in the middle of the book; you find yourself disliking many of the characters and wondering where the plot is going. But by the end, when the narrative arc reaches it's crest, you are totally drawn into the story.I've rarely come across a book with such polarized reviews, which almost equally span the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-star Amazon rating system. Clearly, many people are rating the book based on their expectations for a novel by such a renowned author, rather on the merits of the plotting and characterization.

I am a person who likes to read about someone doing courageous things and/or helping others achieve their best. The only character in The Casual Vacancy deserving of that description dies at the very beginning of the book and the suffering people of Pagford and Yarvil march from there to the pointless death of two children, countless family relations broken, and several careers trashed by the end of the book.I look forward with hopeful optimism to J.K.

"0316228532","A44T8C0ZE69GF","John M. Grohol ""docjohng""","Now we know...","What if you were to take all of the characters in the Harry Potter series, removed the magic and wizardry and spells, and transported them to two little towns somewhere in England? Would anyone care to read the ensuing story of small town politics, and smaller-town lives?I suspect if the name wasn't ""Rowling,"" nobody would've bothered much with this story. It's long. Like so long by the time you're a third of the way through the book, you wonder if the plot is ever going to move forward. Molasses running in the winter moves faster than this story.And the cast of characters! You only have to keep track of something like 2 or 3 dozen of them. Much like a soap opera, Rowling tries to show us each of their motivations and backstories, but it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all. Honestly, I'm not even sure who the central character of the book is.I'm being generous when I gave this book 2 stars. I actually feel it's closer to 1 1/2 stars, because the writing is good. But like many who read this book, I'm not from England, so many of the English-specific terms, cultural references and societal idiosyncrasies -- even the language in some places -- are largely lost on me. And there's a lot of them.We now know Rowling's writing style beyond a doubt. Tell a story filled with so many characters, you either love it or want to gouge your eyes out in keeping track of them all. I'm in the latter category. A faster-moving plot would be delightful as well.",2,"06 24, 2013",1372032000,"[0, 1]"

After enjoying her Young Adult Harry Potter series, I knew this was a more mature book, but really didn't know much about it. The jacket write-up wouldn't normally be enough to rope me in, but the strength of Rowling's other works was.The Casual Vacancy fits nicely into the structure of my favorite style of short story. I enjoy short stories that are small slices of history, where the reader is dropped into the middle of Things Happening. Without too much setup and background, the story progresses, and then the reader leaves the auditorium, while the play continues on outside the scope of the short story itself.Right off the bat, we are introduced to the character that ends up being the tragic Barry Fairbrother, who drops dead almost immediately. The remainder of the book is the village of Pagford's attempt to fill the Casual Vacancy on the village Parish Council left by Fairbrother's unexpected passing. Along the way, we are taken for a lovely ride through small village politics, and are shown that no town is too small to minimally reflect problems of larger metropolitan areas. Sex, drugs, backstabbing, gossip, political posturing, petty jealousy - it's all there. And it's all told in a wonderfully told in a decidedly British style.At first, I didn't quite get caught up in the characters until that of Krystal Morrison was introduced. Hers was one of the most interesting, and her stories kept me engaged enough to finally warm up to the rest of the cast. For the most part, everyone in Pagford is connected to Barry Fairbrother in some way or the other, and the impact of his death is felt by many.If you think this story is going to be gentle, kid-safe and feel-good, you will be disappointed. It's gritty, harsh and quite mature. And it's a very enjoyable book.Audiobook note: I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Tom Hollander. For the most part, he did a great job, but there were definitely some parts that were difficult to understand, mostly because of the different types of accents he portrayed for the various characters. Each character had their own distinct voice, which is always nice.",4,"01 28, 2014",1390867200,"[1, 2]"

What took J.D. Salinger to describe in The Catcher in the Rye, Rowling does in The Casual Vacancy, but across more characters and age groups. I am not saying that Rowling's work is inferior at all, but she can plumb the depths of the human soul with all it's earnestness, hypocrisy, pain, vengefulness, passions high and low, like Salinger. However, Rowling uses a dozen major characters, almost all well developed and tangible, instead of two. Rowling does develop the story around one character who dies at the beginning of the story, yet had provided a foil for so many citizens in his town.This story passed my nap test. Every Saturday afternoon, I sit in the car while one of my children volunteers, and I use the time to read, and usually nap. But I didn't with this book. It's not just because of her good reading, but also because there are so many characters, whose names are hard to keep track of. In fact, I made sure I finished it over the weekend, so I wouldn't forget who was who, who was fornicating with who, who was robbing who, who was beating who, who was doing drugs with who, and who composed the various love triangles. I am not diminishing how well Rowling incarnates her characters, the ability I really appreciated in theHarry Potterseries, but I almost needed a cheat sheet at the back of the book.Kids are great at seeing self-delusion in others, especially their parents. One boy reflects on his mother's complicity in accepting the abuse his father inflicts on the family. ""He had always seen Ruth as separate, good and untainted. As a child, his parents had appeared to him as starkly as black and white, the one bad and frightening, the other good and kind. Yet as he had grown older, he kept coming up hard in his mind against Ruth's willing blindness, to her constant apologia for his father, to the unshakable allegiance to her false idol."" p. 289 Unfortunately, in the book, as in real life, the kids who can be adept at observation are not adept at solutions.There are bigger issues in the town of Pagford. In Mitt Romney's words there are the makers and the takers, and the makers are sick of the takers and want to hand the low-income housing neighborhood over to a larger, neighboring city. They are tired of having to pay to help these people who should help themselves. In the same way as the kids, they can see a problem but are not adept at compassion, because that involves cash and tolerance of difference, both of which the town councilors are feeling short. She portrays the convictions of the makers and their position without prejudice, but makes the case, using the lives of the makers as examples, that we can't know the depth of pain others walk around with, and which can drive some to more debilitating choices than others. In Pagford, at least, the makers are hypocrites.One of the Catcher in the Rye themes I always liked was the hypocrisy of the adolescent in search of authenticity. She writes like a mother of an adolescent when the guidance counselor wishes she could tell the kids, ""You must accept the reality of other people. You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we think it's whatever you say it is. You must accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God."" p.88 Words every adult who works with adolescents or lives with them wishes they could get some kids to understand. But it's also Rowling's message to her adult readers.In case you haven't heard, this is an adult book. Rowling has an ear for slang, which was fun in the Potter books, but outside of Hogwarts, in the English countryside, f-bombs fall like dandelion seeds across every page. Not only are people using the word, they are doing it, teens and adults, and not behind closed doors either, Rowling brings us right into the bedroom, or behind the bushes, wherever people are doing it, and giving us a play by play. It was awkward for me. It was a little forced, as if Rowling could finally put in the scenes she knew were happening in Hogwarts over seven books, but had to wait for her first single adult book to try them out, all of them.Nevertheless, she is an excellent writer. She spins a good tale. She has a moral to her tale. It's influenced by her own experience as a taker for a time, a single mother in need of assistance. Her NPR interview is enlightening. It's too bad the some of the makers have no time to read this and think about why to live compassionately with the poor. However, not even Jesus Christ can get through to them. Now that she's a maker, I'm glad she hasn't forgotten her past, nor her common humanity. If your kids are only in the snogging stage, do not get this for them for the holidays. But if you are an adult, this book may be worth your time.",4,"11 12, 2012",1352678400,"[2, 2]"

Rowling new novelThe Casual Vacancy, but the magic is that she has clearly and adeptly transitioned away from the Harry Potter days, and done it in a very skillful way. And yes, I've read it from beginning to end, but more on that later, as this is a review about Ms. Rowling's new offering and not about meThe red cover with its big X in the check-box is the first thing we see, and it's attention-getter, cleverly designed by Mario Pulice and illustrated by Joel Holland. Then in Part One we see the following:""6.11 A casual vacancy is deemed to have occurred:(a) when a local councillor fails to make his declaration of acceptance of office within the proper time; or(b) when his notice of resignation is received; or(c) on the day of his death...Charles Arnold-BakerLocal Council Administration, Seventh Edition""That small blurb sets the pace for what follows starting in the small, fictional English village of Pagford on a Sunday, with parish council member Barry Fairbrother's bad headache. By that evening, he's dead, the victim of an apparent aneurism in the parking lot of the local golf course. We soon find that his demise leaves behind a grieving widow, four children, eight members of the high school team that he coached, and a town that has some interesting characters.It turns out that Pagford is not such idyllic little English village that one finds in postcards. It's actually a nasty little place, full of simmering resentment, pretentiousness, extreme sexual frustration and poorly disguised bigotry. The death of Barry Fairbrother creates a vacuum within the parish council, the aforementioned ""casual vacancy,"" and that's when the scramble starts. There's Simon Price, a trash-mouth petty thief who sees the council position as an opportunity for bribery and blackmail. Another candidate is Colin Wall, the school principal. Then there's Miles Mollison, the son of a current council member. His parents want to see him elected to support their own local issues.And at issue is the Fields, a low-income neighborhood whose residents are blight on the landscape in the eyes of the 'better' Pagford citizens. When alive, Barry had been the primary opponent of the council's plan to reassign the Fields to the district council of the neighboring city, Yarvil, thus dumping the responsibilities for its poverty-ridden occupants, and driving them out of the area of Pagford's 'nice' primary school.The characters are woven into this landscape like the motley threads of a grimy tapestry. The late Barry Fairbrother had been mentoring a trash-mouthed teenage Fields girl named Krystal Weedon, who is fooling around with school principal Colin Wall's son. He's the best buddy of with Simon Price's son, who is in love with the daughter of the caseworker assigned to Krystal. You almost need a scorecard to keep track of the characters, along with the misdeeds of the parents.Then the election really heats up when slanderous (but accurate) allegations, posted by ""the Ghost of Barry Fairbrother,"" start showing up on the council's Website.&#9734;&#9734; A Spoiler Alert of sorts... &#9734;&#9734;For those hoping that Hogwarts will suddenly appear, it won't, and this is unquestionably not a book for children, and perhaps for some adults as well. Within the pages here, you'll find rape, drug addiction, suicide, thrashings and other similar topics. There is an ironic sex scene set in a cemetery, along with a number of references to condoms, both wrapped and used. The f*** word is used many times over, as a noun, an adjective an adverb and as an outright expletive. The language alone may be enough to turn some loyal J.K. Rowling fans away in shock and surprise. You've been warned; the choice is yours.Beyond all that, it's obvious that author Rowling has made the transition from young adult to purely adult novels. It's largely well written, though it does fall flat in places, and can sometimes seem flat and dull. On more than one occasion I wondered if the author was peppering this tale with profanity and truly lurid actions to deflect us from a plot that seemed to be foundering. On the other hand, there are some memorable characters, though some of them are quite potty-mouthed, to put it mildly. And every once in awhile, we see J.K. Rowlings' sense of humor shine through.Showing my age here, but the theme of the author's debut adult book reminded me of the 1956 novelPeyton Placeby the late Grace Metalious. Her controversial story, with its scandals and sexual intrigue, stayed on The New York Times bestseller list for over a year, and eventually spawned a film and a television series that ran for a few years. I can see all those things happening with Ms. Rowling's new novel as well.I had ordered the Kindle edition this book when it was first announced. Was on my Kindle Fire very early today and reading the latest issue ofAmerican Photowhen the new book suddenly popped up and downloaded. I made a mistake and started reading, so pardon any typos in my review here as I've had about an hour of sleep. The Kindle edition is decently formatted with a readable sans-serif font, and I found it easy to read on the Kindle Fire as well as my Kindle 2.In this reader's eyes,The Casual Vacancyis a good, though not great. It's an over-hyped book with some memorable characters, yet it has a truly emotional payoff at the end. Subjectively calling it a 3-star read, maybe four stars at the outside: good but not great. But I'm actually looking forward to seeing what author J.K. Rowling will offer us next.If you can deal with the profanity and some of the topics noted above in my spoiler alert, then you may find it worth reading. If those subjects disturb you, then pass this title by and be glad that you have so many other titles available to read in the Kindle format or paper editions.9/27/2012",3,"09 27, 2012",1348704000,"[1, 2]"

I fall into the positive camp - this was a book I read quickly and enjoyed quite a bit.  It reminded me, in a way, of Richard Russo's books in the way it takes a town and examines it and its inhabitants closely, never really feeling the need to desire to stray from the town's borders.  Everything, and everyone, the book needs is within the town's reach.  The book touches on lots of issues, some pretty and some not - poverty, disease, snobbery, politics, education to name a few.  It also takes a deep dive into a number of the characters' lives and examines the realities of every day life:  a man frozen by his fears, a woman held captive to her bad taste in men and her constant belief that she'll get her fairy-tale ending, an essentially good kid destroyed by the poverty and lack of guidance surrounding her, parents utterly unaware of the life their children lead, petty people effecting small cruelties that their small lives permit them.  It also beautifully illustrates how fundamentally one person can touch so many lives and cause a town to literally unravel when he passes away.  This is the stuff of life, and sometimes it is ugly, and petty - and sometimes beautiful and soaring.  We get to go along for the ride as people get sick and heal, succeed and fail, rise and fall.  By the end of the book, I really cared about some of the characters - and really disliked others for their smallness and cruelty.  But the fact that I cared (good or bad) shows the skill that Rowling brings to this book.  For only a gifted author can leave us caring so much, right?What this isn't is an adventure story (that is, this isn't Harry Potter, and if you are expecting a grown up version of HP, don't bother with this book).  My guess is that many who gave negative reviews didn't realize that Rowling apparently meant to leave behind what she was famous for and move onto more adult fiction.  Harry Potter this isn't.  It's a fast read, but it isn't a fast story and fast events and violent action.  It moves along at just about the speed our real lives do.In the end, if you want to read a deep and penetrating novel that will make you care for the characters in the book, wonder what happens next and keep reading deep into the night, this is a great choice.  It won't always be pretty, and everything isn't going to end up tied with a bow.  But that's just the point of this book to me - it's meant to be a picture of real life, with all its highs and lows, told through the prism of a small town in the middle of England.  If you are willing to think and engage, this is a wonderful place to do it.And (SPOILER ALERT) - I sure hope that poor A. got one kiss from G. before she left town!",5,"12 20, 2013",1387497600,"[0, 0]"

"0316228532","A3RK5D0VVDGCPP","Josh Mauthe","Set aside your expectations and savor this cynical, heart-breaking, honest look at the world","It's best to put aside any preconceptions you might have about what The Casual Vacancy will be like before you read it. That's hard to do in any situation, but when the author is J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, that's even more so; no matter what, you'll have certain expectations or ideas about what The Casual Vacancy might be like. It's to Rowling's credit, I think, that the book defies almost any expectation anyone had, delivering not a genre book, not a light-hearted book, but a cynical, dark look at modern society, politics, poverty, strained family relationships, and more. Nominally, The Casual Vacancy is about the aftermath of a death in a small English town, a death which opens up a seat on the ruling body in the town (the titular vacancy). But in reality, Rowling uses the death as a way to open up this insular world and its dramas for the reader to explore. Rowling's working with a sprawling cast of characters here, and her effortless gliding between perspectives, dialects, philosophies, and thoughts is just one of the many joys for someone like me who was curious how her prose would differ as she took on the adult world. Indeed, Rowling's prose and craft is generally superb, weaving between the past and present, sliding between characters, and juggling dozens of plot threads only to collide them at unexpected moments - it's a masterful performance from a technical perspective, and left me impressed with just how far Rowling had come from the first Potter novel so many years ago. The subject matter has been more problematic for some people, with some feeling lost in just how ferociously cynical and vicious The Casual Vacancy can be. While Rowling has created dozens of rich characters, none of them are heroes, and not one is without a flaw - sometimes, there are a multitude of them. That's led some to discount the book as being without likeable characters, which is an absurd charge to me; while there are no doubt some despicable people here, it's not hard to feel that Rowling has a surprising amount of empathy for all of them (albeit some more than others). Similarly, the subject matter here can be dark, but that's appropriate; with much of the book revolving around the town's effort to rid itself of the government housing for the poor and the drug clinic that's helping many escape their addictions, it would be absurd and offensive to minimize the suffering and difficulty that comes along with such a life. Instead, Rowling focuses beautifully on both sides, attempting to understand those who look down on the inhabitants of the projects while also attempting to be a voice for those who had no chance at anything better. If you take The Casual Vacancy as, in effect, a debut novel, you'll be deeply impressed; while there are no doubt a few missteps (for example: there's a subplot about hacking that feels a bit repetitive and a bit like a deus ex machina, and occasionally the massive cast gets a bit overwhelming and confusing), what you have here is an assured, confident step into the literary world. Rowling is taking a huge gamble here, trading her genre work in for something more literary, trading her hopefulness in for brutal realism, and focusing a lot on the many ways that human beings can find themselves lacking in empathy for even those they love. The end result is a fantastic novel, one that I read pretty much any time I had free moments, and one that hit me pretty hard as it came to its powerful climax. It's not often enough that novelists are willing to write about social classes and the conflicts between them, or the way that politics can obscure our basic humanity towards each other, and yet Rowling takes both issues on, all while spinning tales about parents and children, the way we cope with loss, and so much more. For its short length, The Casual Vacancy is an ambitious, complex novel, but it's also a very human one underneath that - and to me, that may be the most important thing.",5,"02 13, 2013",1360713600,"[0, 0]"
"0316228532","A2WVAIDJQTVOAX","Joshua Gross","It Doesn't Have to be About Wizards To Be Good","This was an interesting book. JK Rowling created some in-depth characters and situations, and it was interesting to read how they interacted with and misunderstood each other. The plot and characters were well crafted and came together well at the end. I think JK Rowling has written a perfectly fine book for adults and has proven she knows what she's doing, despite all the readers out there wondering why there's no wizards and why it's not more fun. The Casual Vacancy explores the lives of realistic characters in a confusing and often tragic realistic world. It also raises many questions about what's important and what's not, and how things appear as opposed to how they really are. I read this book because I appreciate JK Rowling and I knew reading something she had written would be worthwhile.My only major issue with the book was how it changed perspective so often. It would switch from the point of view from one character to the point of view of another character with nothing more than a sentence in between. This made it difficult to read at times, particularly towards the end when all the characters are in the same place and the perspective shifts from person to person all through the chapter. While I thought this was an odd way of doing things, it didn't change the fact that JK Rowling has written a very good, thought-provoking, and ambitious novel.",5,"10 12, 2012",1350000000,"[3, 4]"

"0316228532","ADCC3WHSZNW1R","J. Richardson","8.5/10 - Great","Five years ago J.K. Rowling closed up the Harry Potter series with The Deathly Hallows and now she is back with her first book outside of that series. While I still have the subject of Harry Potter fresh in your mind let me dedicate this first paragraph to a complaint. How come in almost every negative review I have read the reviewer has made some comparison to the Harry Potter franchise? And if it's not a direct comparison it's some lame joke like ""there's no magic here."" Is that supposed to be clever? You wouldn't compare two different movies a director made would you? No. So don't do that with this book. It's not fair to the writer who put so much time and effort into making this piece of literature and it's not fair to you because you aren't allowing yourself to enjoy it. You're setting yourself up for disappointment. If you don't like it, don't like it because you didn't enjoy it, not because it lacked magic.With that out of the way let me just say wow! I was a little skeptical when I first started reading this because I didn't really know what it was about, but Rowling's books were such a huge part of my childhood that I couldn't not read it. This woman knows how to craft an excellent story with characters that you both love and hate. Then there are others that you love in the beginning and by the end of the book you want to punch them in the face.As many reviewers have already said this is her first ""novel for adults."" When I read that my first reaction was what does that even mean? To me ""for adults"" means an erotic novel, so I was a little worried. Not because those kinds of books don't have a place in literature, but because it would have been a huge leap for her in terms of subject matter. Even though compared to her earlier works this does touch on more mature themes, it's feels more like she's testing the waters in this new range of topics she can work with. Which is where my first complaint comes in.I've seen other reviewers say this and I completely agree with them, it's exactly what went through my mind while reading this. Because she's finally able to branch out and try new things it feels a little like she's trying to prove herself. If you try to think of every mature theme you can possibly think of, it's probably in here. There's sex, rape, suicide, underage drinking, drug addiction, death, and self-harming. While I don't have a problem with any of these topics, trying to cram each of them into one novel is kind of overwhelming.Another complaint is that the story takes some time to pick up. When it first starts it feels crazy because you get these new characters and all of a sudden some big event happens. So while you're still getting used to this new setting there's a big commotion and it's all very exciting, but once again it's also a little overwhelming. Then once all the excitement dies down the book comes to a sudden stop and feels very boring for a while.The novel is set up into seven parts, a little nod to her long-time fans, with the first part taking place during the first week after the big event at the beginning. Now there's a section in part one, Olden Days, that talks about the history of the town. During this section I was really debating closing the book and giving up because it was extremely dull. I'm glad I didn't, but when you're trying to bring people into this new world it's best not start a story and then have it come to a screeching halt. Maybe having it be the novel's prologue would have been a better decision. Part two, for me, is when the story really picked up. Once I started part two that was it, i was committed and this quickly became a page turner.My only other complaint is that the setting of the book isn't very interesting. To tell you the truth I kept getting confused when they were talking about Pagford, Yarvill, and all of the towns. It got to the point where I gave up trying to keep up when a conversation was started about the topic. I'm going to re-read the book so maybe I'll have a better understanding the second time, but after reading it for the first time the city felt very blah. It lacked any sort of life and it ended up feeling very unimportant.Throughout these 512 pages you will be introduced to a lot of characters, some interesting others not so much. So many, in fact, that I found it difficult to keep up at first. Especially when you consider the fact that each of them gets around the same amount of attention, and that's not an exaggeration. The only characters who didn't get the same amount of attention as everyone else were Paul Price, the Fairbrother children, the Mollison children, and Vikram Jawanda. Personally, my two favorite characters where Andrew Price and Krystal Weedon. I won't go into detail about their stories, but I felt that they brought the most to the table. Both of them had full fledged personalities and felt like people you would meet in the real world. Simon Price, Andrew's father, has to be the character I hated the most. I hated him from the moment he was introduced in the story. Again, I won't go into detail, but he's just a huge jackass.Overall Score: 8.5/10 - The Casual Vacancy touches on a wide range of emotions. It is both happy and sad, evil and kind, and by the end you're sure to feel something for these characters. I've seen some reviewers say that this book is depressing, but I feel that's a bit of an overstatement. It isn't depressing, it just isn't forgiving. It wants to make you feel something and I think Rowling did a wonderful job at accomplishing that. This book is far from perfect, but it's definitely something I would recommend checking out. It may take some time to pick up, but if you pull through the slow beginning the rest of the story is very rewarding.",4,"11 15, 2012",1352937600,"[0, 0]"

The plot lumbers along at a moderate pace, introducing characters of the town of Pagford and outlining their situations.  While Rowling excels at character development, the townsfolk in this novel are unsavory, bordering on detestable.  Junkies, wife beaters, ambitious small-town politicians, despondent wives, and horny teenagers make up this cast.  Once everyone's intrigues are presented, the pacing slows down for the latter two-thirds of the book until the last 40-ish pages.  There's a mildly tragic and somewhat climactic conclusion, but by the end, I just wanted to be finished.  There were some decent little sub-plots and some deserving characters got their comeuppance, but the daily minutiae of Pagford was monotonous.Rowling's character development succeeds, no doubt.

In fact, some of the teens are the same ages as the students her in other novels, but very worldly. It seems that in the whole town, not one family has a normal relationship and no one has a good parent/teen relationship.

When a well-liked local councilman dies, the fight for his seat becomes the primary plot point. At issue is the fate of a not-so-good area of town, The Fields, and whether the local community should cast it off.This book is most certainly a character-driven novel more so than plot-driven. Not too much actually happens (until the end) but we follow the complex lives and intertwined relationships of the town. My biggest struggle was remember who was who for the first 10-20 percent. I would *highly* recommend anyone who reads this look up a list of characters on the web. I used the Kindle Search function quite a bit until I got them all straight.Anyway, I had a lot of trouble getting into the novel. I likely would have put it down after the equivalent of 74 pages (my 100-your age rule of how much to give a book) had it not been for my fiancee also reading it. However, by about 45 percent, I was interested...enough.I found that Rowling only did an adequate job of filling in important character details. Many questions about the history of the characters remain, even if they aren&#8217;t vital (ex, why did the Wall&#8217;s have to adopt? How did Barry come to his position on the council? What came of Parminder Jawanda?).Furthermore, a few plot points were a stretch. (How did Fats learn enough to hack the site? And Sukhvinder? Why did Krystal jump to the making a baby idea? What about her rape?). It was details like that which left my scratching my head.Anyway, right now, having just finished, I would rate the book 2/5. I imagine this is the kind of thing that when I look back on it, I will appreciate it more as I think about the characters and the life they led.Oh, and I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention that I found one GLARING Harry Potter reference: &#8221;They might have been involved in some secret war of which the rest of the world knew nothing&#8221; (Location 715/8045 on my ebook version, around 9 percent).",2,"12 3, 2013",1386028800,"[1, 1]"

She needed to give voice to the characters who inhabit this world; the lower, working and middle class people who all - each and every one - live separate from this world, and not of it.  They are the lonely, the misunderstood, the alienated.  They are legion.  For all of the couple of dozen characters we meet within the covers of this remarkably bleak book, there is hardly one who does not end the book as they started - lost and lonely.Ms. Rowling is a remarkable storyteller, as attested by her previous works; but the world of those books, where virtue will triumph over tremendous odds and all things are possible if you are in the right, is nowhere to be found in the small village of Pagford where a ""casual vacancy"" (A casual vacancy is deemed to have occurred: (a) when a local councillor fails to make his declaration of acceptance of office within the proper time; or (b) when his notice if resignation is received; or (c) on the day of his death.) is caused by the sudden death of a member of the village board, and the ensuing political infighting has far-reaching consequences.A lovely line from early on in the book says it all, ""Both... were contemplating the casual vacancy: and saw it, not as an empty space but as a magician's pocket, full of possibilities.""This is a world where secrets cover darker secrets and hardly anything is what it appears, and an existence of quiet, hopeless desperation is the established norm.  Rowling's people are as real as any you'll find in fiction, and you'll care about them in spite of yourself; even when they do unconventional, irrational, and totally infuriating things.  You care.  But it will do neither them, nor you, any good.  They are stuck in their world.  Nothing can help them, and nothing will help them.  This book is a ""cri du coeur"".  Notice these people.  Know that they exist.  Acknowledge them.  (Not that you could ever help them; that would be asking too much.)This is, as I said earlier, a bleak book.  I cannot like it.  I can only admire it.  I'm glad that I read it, but I will not read it a second time.

It's much harder to swallow that this is written by the author that created such incredible images with her writing in any other novel that she did, an author that had me glued to each page of her book(s) from the very first sentence. If I didn't know better, I would think that someone was lying about the author of this book.The story by itself may have been okay, but the writing is borderline torturous to read. The overly abundant characters are severely underdeveloped which makes following this difficult story even more painful. On top of that, there is such an onslaught of unnecessarily vulgar remarks, almost seeming like Rowling randomly threw in the obscene comments without regard to if they made sense or not. Perhaps that's what Rowling thought was needed to be considered an adult writer, but it only seemed forced and useless. Between the awkward situations happening with the barely-there characters and the entirely meaningless focus on body parts, Rowling severely missed the mark with this novel.If you're looking for great read, keep looking! In general, The Casual Vacancy was the biggest literary disappointment and will have J.K. Rowling fans everywhere crying in outrage.",1,"11 11, 2012",1352592000,"[1, 4]"

Wainwright","No warmth!","Rowling obviously did not intend to paint working class society in UK as a warm and fuzzy bunch, but immediately, in the first chapter, killing off the only individual who seems to have had some warmth or charitable quality, results in a book full of rather unlikable individuals.  None of the long list of characters have any genuine affection for each other, so it is very difficult to root for anyone.  Self distructive, on the road to nowhere, the characters become rather cartoonish, like the Dursley's in 'Harry Potter'.  I would even go as far as to say that her characters are so mean, they are unrealistic.  Life has redeeming aspects to it as well as tragedies, so despite the love of the acerbic, this book disappointed me.

Somehow this story is just not interesting to me.  I read thru the ""see inside for a quick peek"" ... it still does not call me.  I don't doubt that JK Rowling had put together great prose and great observations, but I just can't read through it without falling asleep. I guess I'm just not  that interested in provincial English country life or something like that.10/10/2012 update: I stopped by the bookstore and tried to read it again. I'm struck by the fact that JKR used so many curse words. I thought that the whole point of great authors is that they are wordsmiths - able to deliver the emotional content/descriptions without swearing and vulgar. Swearing and cursing are really signs of people who are incapable of speaking.  If this is JKR's INTENT on showing us provincial English country life - that is a SAD STATE of affairs.  So now the English people are so SUBSTANDARD they can't even carry on a conversation without swear words?Adults can express themselves fully without swearing, cursing, or being vulgar.

"0316228532","A35V1N17E446RX","Karen A. Wyle","Jane Austen redux","Coming from Rowling's Harry Potter series to her first book for adults, I had not anticipated how much it would remind me of the novels of Jane Austen.  Austen famously worked with a small canvas, focusing on the foibles and concerns of residents of small and insular communities. Rowling does the same. If one imagines Austen transplanted to the present, freed from any pressure to adhere to romantic conventions, and urged to give reign to all her darker and more cynical impulses, we might have something like this novel.To be sure, the Harry Potter series does showcase Rowling's impressive ability to paint compelling and unflattering portraits. But in those books, characters like Cornelius Fudge and the wonderfully detestable Dolores Umbridge act as antagonists or foils for likeable and admirable characters.  In A Casual Vacancy, they comprise most, if not all, of the human landscape. One's response to almost every character is essentially: ""My God, I hope I'm not like that.""Some reviews have stated that the only likable or admirable character in this book is the man who dies at its beginning, and whose death occasions the entire plot. I would qualify this statement in two ways. First, there are a couple of other characters who do worthwhile jobs as best they can, against discouraging odds. However, even these characters are sufficiently flawed and foolish in various aspects of their personal lives as to prevent the reader from wishing to identify with them. Second, this limitation extends to some extent to the soon-departed Barry Fairbrother. While there are reasons (starting with the character's unsubtle name) to believe that we are intended to side with him in the dispute over Pagford's responsibility for the Fields housing project, his view of that project and of certain of its residents could be fairly characterized as somewhat one-sided and optimistic. It is even clearer that his tireless advocacy leads him to neglect aspects of his family life.At one point, Rowling has a character recall the W.B. Yeats line, ""A pity beyond all telling/ is hid at the heart of love."" For much of the book, one might question whether Rowling feels that pity. In the end, I was more or less persuaded that she does. She ultimately succeeds in making the reader care, to a varying extent, about the fates of these deeply flawed characters. The book is thus eventually moving, rather than merely disheartening.",4,"11 24, 2012",1353715200,"[1, 1]"

I read them at the time my granddaughters and niece were reading the series to keep up with the books that had ""taken over"" their young lives. While I didn't find the Potter series to be especially well written, I always kept in mind that it was written for children. The Casual Vacancy is not a children's book and should not be read with the same kind of expectations.Knowing the setting was a small English village I looked forward to reading it. I love cozy's set in small towns, general fiction set in small towns and in fact, I live in a small town and am familiar with how they tend to operate. They are pretty much the same no matter what country you live in, because people are the same around the world. Having said that, this story may have been set in a small town but it reads more like a city.Was it good? No not really. Nor was it especially poor. The author tried a bit too hard to bring too many characters into the story which left character development rather sparing. I felt as if she were trying hard to create an epic novel which fell flat. The beginning was slow, the middle interesting and the ending was manipulative. I didn't find myself either liking or identifying with any of the protagonists which is a necessary feature if you want people to enjoy the story.No, Ms, Rowling, the ending did not make me cry.

"0316228532","A19EDFJ6PD9MRA","Karen Hancock","A Fascinating Character Study in Abnormal Psychology","When Barry Fairbrother drops dead of an aneurism while celebrating his wedding anniversary with his wife at the local golf club in the small town of Pagford, it leaves a &#8220;casual vacancy&#8221; on the parish council.  Residents of the town react differently to Fairbrother&#8217;s death, and the novel&#8217;s main focus is on the interaction of the different personalities, how they are affected by the death, and how they plot and scam to use the death to their advantage.J.K. Rowling, in her adult novel debut, exhibits her masterful style and uncanny way of describing human frailties and reactions to events &#8211; in this case Barry Fairbrother&#8217;s death.  Of course most would not admit to being secretly glad about Fairbrother&#8217;s death, but several are, some because of the vacancy on the parish council, and others because they didn&#8217;t particularly like him.  Others, of course are devastated by his death.Rowling is also able to capture the way that humans like to take tragic events and turn them into something that is &#8220;all about me.&#8221;  When the events leading to the death, and also the death itself are not yet well-known, Rowling describes how some of the characters anticipate and plan how they will break the news to people they know so that they are in the spotlight and somehow are praiseworthy human beings for delivering the news.  Miles and Samantha Mollison, slight acquaintances of the Fairbrothers, just happened to be at the restaurant, and accompanied Mary Fairbrother and her husband&#8217;s body to the hospital.  Their delivery of the news to Miles&#8217; father raises his worth in the eyes of his father, and of course, generates attention to him, and gives Miles an advantage to his run for the vacant council seat.There are several sub-plots running through the novel, generating suspenseful scenarios, and showing the &#8220;true colors,&#8221; of the different characters.  Simon Price, for instance, appears to be an upstanding, albeit very private, citizen of the town, but is actually an abusive husband and father with a clear case of abnormal personality disorder.  Samantha is a narcissist, Howard Mollison is an arrogant & dishonest jerk with an alternate agenda, and Krystal Weedon is a tragic and insecure teenager.  There is no shortage of characters with problems, and no shortage of suspense &#8211; not the kind found in most suspense novels where the main character is in eminent danger from a villain, but of a kind where the eminent danger lies in the individual characters and the consequences of their choices and actions.While the characters are fascinating, they are for the most part unhappy and depressing.  It seems that almost every aspect of abnormal psychology is represented &#8211; a study of the characters and their personalities could certainly take up an entire college semester in an abnormal psychology class.The book, of course, is no Harry Potter with the good guys winning in the end, and bad guys being put in their places.  It is, however, a captivating character study, and although dark, is definitely worth reading, if not for the intriguing scenarios, but for the extraordinary way that Rowling weaves together her plot and characters.This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.",4,"04 13, 2014",1397347200,"[0, 0]"

At times I found myself being pulled away from my emotional investment in the story to wonder why the author had to include such dark behavior, such language, as she did. Like, where are the redeeming qualities of these people...whom can we  root for...was this novel merely a vehicle to distance JKR from her Harry Potter persona, do average teenagers really say, think and do these things, etc?But I stuck with the book, and am happy that I did. Ultimately this is a novel about the ramifications of our actions, about loss and redemption (albeit weak and perhaps short-lived), about tolerance and forgiveness, and about understanding those with whom we have no commonality.3 weeks after finishing the book, I am still haunted by Cubby Walls, Krystal and Terry Wheeden, and Sukhvinder Jawanda; although the other characters remain in memory as well. Turns out that once I saw the author's belief that these characters have been damaged by past experiences, becoming people they might never have aspired to become, I was able to embrace the book.One  hopes that those damaged would receive the opportunities and tools and desire for positive change, and some in the storyline tried valiantly; thus, my remembrances of Cubby, Krystal, Terry and Sukhvinder.Looking forward to keeping this book on the shelf for a while and revisiting it without any preconceived notions or expectations.",4,"11 13, 2012",1352764800,"[0, 0]"

When she first mentioned years ago that she was writing a ""political fairy story for adults"" I didn't think I would be fully on board without more details.  When word came earlier this year that the book would drop during the eight-week ""sweet spot"" before the Presidential Election in the United States I grew leery.  There are a lot of political issues about which Rowling and I seem to generally agree but I felt that the danger of this being a bleak polemic was high.When the download was delivered to my Kindle on release day the font size error made reading difficult.  But I'll read anything; I've been known to hide under the sheets with a flashlight and a magnifying glass to drink in a really great read.  I struggled through the first ""day""; a bleak prologue describing the mundane sadness of the hero's ordinary life, ending with him dead face-down in a pool of his own vomit while his wife of nineteen years crouches by, disheveled and weeping.Good times!(oh, at one point Rowling--presumably not wanting to use the word ""car"" twice in one sentence--refers to the vehicle as ""a people carrier"". Awkwardness, meet Trying too Hard)I ended up returning the Kindle version, giving it up as a bad job.  My 1-star review on GoodReads was greeted with foul language, hate mail and cries of ""no fair! You can't review it if you didn't read it all"".I maintain that one can state equivocally that one does not like a book once you've read enough of it to get the general feel of tone and language.  It's not possible to analyze the whole work, of course, or to discuss themes.  But it is indeed quite possible to make up one's mind after watching  Bored Barry and disinterested Mary take the people carrier through Tweetown to the inevitable brain aneurysm, barf and bawling.  (yes, Mary and Barry.  Political injoke? Cutesypoo attempt at projecting a dull normalcy?  Trying too Hard, meet Awkward.)I've read more excerpts today at the encouragement of fellow bibliophiles.  The book seems to  want so badly to be _The Wire: Season Three_ as told by Jane Austen.  It just feels...empty.No, I haven't read the whole thing and I'm honestly not likely to.

People on the outside think the family is perfect, but just wait....  I also thought the second major theme of the book, who's going to throw a hat into the political ring for a vacated city council seat, is probably so close to the truth of how that really happens than most of us would like to admit.  There were times through the book that I thought, is there no one in this town even remotely happy?  But then I realized this is how life really is, the ugly and the less ugly.  The third theme of 'us vs. them, the haves vs. the have nots, probably plays out in real life very much like it does in the novel.

Barry Fairbrother is apparently the only morally upstanding citizen in the city of Pagford and when he dies, everyone rushes to snatch up what he's left behind.

Here's my advice: Do NOT go into this book expecting 1) A CHILDREN'S story; 2) Feel good, Dumbledore & Harry Save the Day stories; 3) Harry Potter. This is Rowlings first attempt at writing for ADULTS and she did a phenomenal job. Why did people love HP so much? The original storyline? No. We've all heard/read stories of good vs. evil our entire lives... no originality there.. It was her characterization and the connections she made within those characters. It's the familiarity of those characters that made you fall in love. Every single book-nerdy girl felt like Hermione at times or awkward boy felt like Neville... we related to the characters, not the story. And ""Vacancy"" does not fail in that aspect. Am I loving the storyline? Not entirely, but I knew I wouldn't by reading the synopsis... it's just not my ""style"" of story but she's sucking me in anyway. She makes me love and hate those characters because I KNOW them.. they exist in my neighborhood, just like they exist in yours. She really brings the story to life IF you can put down your magic wand and use your grown-up brain. And yes, she uses the big four letter ""c"" word most famously used in ""Atonement"". Get over it.

The characters are all variations on Harry Potter's Aunt and Uncle, with their failings, mean spirited personalities, and foibles. I wanted one character to root for, but sadly, that one person created the casual vacancy and is missing for most of the book. This is not to say Ms. Rowling's failed. I believe she succeeded in her intention--bringing to light a serious problem in her native England.

And I do love her characters.But here -- most of the characters are rather despicable.  At first, I thought I was in for a long story about despicable people, I didn't know what I was getting into.

Rowling and it was actually available when I arrived at the library. I did not intend to read it so soon after it was published and I had very low expectations for it.That said, I am glad I did pick it up because I rather enjoyed it. This is a dark and unpleasant story full of mostly horrible people doing some not-so-nice things. It is a dramatization of real life, full of drugs, sex, violence and politics. It is not fun or fluffy. For these reasons, I would caution fans of Harry Potter before reading this book as they will find a much different world than they had come to know and love. Remember, this is a book intended for adults.I must also admit that I was surprised at how well Rowling actually writes. I remember thinking she was not a great writer when reading Harry Potter (it was the world that is good), but it is clear that she has a great grip on the English language. The only part that I disliked about the writing was the written dialogue of those living in The Fields. It was very difficult to read and felt a bit old-fashioned, but I am not British and do not understand their obsession with the various accents found on their island, so I am wiling to give her a bit of room here.All in all, I'm glad to have read this book and that Rowling wrote it because I would have never thought to pick up the story without her name on it. Not that the book was without flaws, but I do think Rowling has nicely shown that she is a writer of true caliber, not just a fun storyteller of young adult books.",4,"10 7, 2012",1349568000,"[4, 7]"
"0316228532","A11MM2RJ73B5A3","Kim ""kipacha""","Not sure where to begin","After reading the HP novels, I was anticipating the next work of art by JK Rowling.  What I found is a novel that seems to be written for the sole purpose of shock value.  It is a complete departure from the writing style, symbolism, and wholesomeness of her previous works.  The only point I see in this book at all is that Rowling wants to distance herself as far away from the HP novels as possible in an effort to avoid being pigeon holed.  If that was her purpose, she has succeeded.  I found the plot's cohesiveness to be lacking.  The story has a very confusing start with introducing characters with very little connection to each other.  Over time there is some connection, but as a whole the plot and characters are not developed enough despite the staggering amount of pages in this novel.  The last couple of chapters seem to be hurriedly wrapping things up so that the book can have an ending, but the ending is in itself very lacking.  There were enough f-bombs to sink the Titanic, and the amount of time spent on pedophilia, drug addiction, rape, incest, adultery, teenage promiscuity, self-cutting, etc. don't serve much purpose in the novel.  Again I think Rowling just sat down one day and said to herself ""I bet if I write about all the crappiest things that happen in society, they will never say that all I write is children's books.""  Again if this is what she was thinking, she succeeded.  But I would have rather her goal to have been to write an awesome novel that doesn't need adult language and themes to make it sensational.",2,"01 22, 2013",1358812800,"[1, 2]"

Ms. Rowling has a beautiful writing style and can tell amazing stories. However, in her first book written specifically for adults, she tells a very depressing tale of a town at war with itself.As I starting reading this book, I was really confused by all the character introductions. There are a lot of characters in the this book and it is difficult to keep everyone straight. I was about halfway through the book before I obtained a full grasp on all the characters.There aren't many appealing characters in this book. When you think you like someone, he/she will do something horrible; not a lot of redeeming qualities in the town of Pagford. However, Ms. Rowling was able to capture the small-mindedness of a small community. Judgment and prejudice runs rampant throughout Pagford. You feel the animosity felt by all.The hero of the book is the deceased Barry Fairbrother. After his death, he is practically sainted by most in Pagford. His friends want to continue his dream, whether they believe in it or not, and his enemies want to destroy it. This ongoing battle brings out the worst qualities that Barry would have hated.It is so sad on how badly the children are treated. The abuse is very difficult to stomach. The truly innocent do indeed suffer the most.Be prepared that this is a very depressing and sad book. There really isn't anything uplifting in the end. I'm not even sure that any of the characters learned any lessons. They will keep wallowing in their own judgment and misery.In the end, I found this book really difficult and depressing.

Having lived in England for three years near a small rural town I well remember the people and the class differences--not much different really than small town rural USA where I grew up. The story was depressing at times, but I feel Americans have this idea that we should be happy all the time (could be the advertising campaigns we see / hear on TV, radio and in print), but most of our lives are mundane interspersed with moments of happiness. I liked the way the characters lives and histories were brought forward bit by bit. How well do any of us know our neighbors or where they came from; why they have made the choices they have in life and what they'd like to forget? How many of us see injustice around us and turn a blind eye? How many of us live our lives without ever leaving our safe confines, whether physical or intellectual?

I would be hard pressed to call this book fun to read. I love those kinds of fun books, but they're not the only kind.

This is a book you can dissect and discuss and find more and more layers and juxtapositions and themes. This is the kind of book where you can discuss the characters with others like they were actual people, and not fictional portrayals of people. This a book that lets you talk about writing or story telling as a craft.This is a book that challenges your sympathy and understanding as it makes you make a snap judgement about a character and their situation at first only to find you actually feel very differently as you get to know them. In fact, you feel differently about them depending on what they're doing, or whose point of view is predominate. It is not a book where what happens matters or is even particularly interesting, but where what people do and why matters. This is the kind of book that makes you angry at the characters for not making connections with others that could make all the difference, which makes the times that they do make a connection all the more valuable. This is a book that makes you angry at the book, for making such an unfair world. This is the kind of book that haunts you the next day after you've finished.It's not an ""easy"" or a ""fun"" book, although I certainly appreciated its own dark humor.

I usually do not read books with main characters that I dislike, and this was a book where I did not like many of the characters... sometimes.  At other times I liked them best.

No, this is NOT IN ANY WAY a book for children or young adults.Let me start with a little background.  J.K. Rowling may be a multimillionaire now, but it is a very recent change in her condition.  While she has not said it outright, she grew up in at least a volatile home, if not an abusive one.  When she wrote the first Harry Potter she was ""as poor as it is possible to be in Britain and not be homeless.""  So when she writes about the harsh reality that her characters live in, she probably has seen it in real life.A Casual Vacancy was billed as a dark comedy, but it is more of a tragedy written in the form of a character study.  The story is not so much action driven, as a snapshot of a town and it's inhabitants at a certain moment in time.  Many people will not like the book just because of these two things.Barry Fairbrother, a member of the Parrish (town) council in Pagford, drops dead of an aneurysm in the golf club parking lot on his wedding anniversary.  After a brief mourning period people in the town begin to scheme and plan as to who should fill his seat on the council, as the council is about to decide on a controversial matter.  Pagford is trying to shuffle off the responsibility for The Fields (the local ghetto neighborhood)to Yarvile, the larger town in the district.  Along with with this, they are trying to evict the methadone clinic in the fields from their current building, which the Parish owns.  The lines are clearly divided, and it will be a close vote.  As the election moves closer accusations against various council members and candidates appear on the council website under the name ""The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother,"" and tensions in the town are flying high.  But there is more at stake than anyone really understands.  Ms. Rowling is very blunt about the reality that her characters live in.  This book portrays spousal and child abuse, both physical and mental, drug usage, rape, bullying, self-mutilation, and  death without blinking an eye.  She gives the reader no quarter.Ms. Rowling uses this situation to show exactly how damaging the current movement of austerity is, and how far reaching the ramifications are.  What you may see as ""common sense politics"" may be the difference between life and death, food and hunger, abuse and safety, for someone else.  These decisions have real-life consequences that go far beyond your own pocketbook.  This book is very, very good, and it is utterly heartbreaking.  As I finished the last chapters of the book, with tears running down my cheeks, I had one phrase running through my mind.

However, the reviewers also said that the book picks up in the second half and they were correct about that as well. I hung in there and at about the 60% mark the novel finally became engrossing as the characters began to act out on their previously internalized hostilities toward one another. Payback is always fun and interesting. The ending was satisfying if not wonderful, and did tie up loose ends.If you're a devoted fan of the author, you may want to give this a try. It is well written, though some stricter editing was in order, which is the same way I felt about the last three Potter novels. Just keep in mind that you are going to have to get through 300 pages to get to the ""good part"" and you will be in the company of some really terrible people during that time.",3,"10 13, 2012",1350086400,"[0, 0]"

"0316228532","A2MOCTAR9DWHO4","Ladybug","Small town folks, big and dense book","Even though I kept in mind that this was Rowling's first adult novel and that she was entitled, just like any other first time author, to make mistakes, I must admit that I didn't particularly enjoy reading it. Moreover, I kept putting it down and finding myself excuses to do anything but read it.The one good thing I have to say about this book is that this is mainly the story of the people of Pagford. This is where the strength of the J.K. Rowling as we have come to know her in the ""HP"" series, is. Her characters, although numerous, all bring their contribution to the story and help it move forward as they evolve and follow their paths, whether for better or worse. They are all of them distinct in their own way. I particularly liked her teens, which as we know seems to be her forte. Although her adults are also well built, at the end of the day you feel naturally drawn to these teens and their lives, especially in my case to the central teen character, Krystal Wheedon who leaves a lasting impression event after you're done reading the book.Now what I didn't really like is the fact that the story, although mainly about the characters, remains difficult to follow and the pacing might have a lot to do with it. The pacing here is that of our normal lives where some days are over packed with activities or action and others where nothing really important happens. It is okay in real life, but in a book, it makes the reading tedious and I got easily bored. Should the book have been shorter, it might have worked, but here the length creates a dragging effect and some scenes were definitely too long and even, at times, unnecessary.Moreover, Rowling tries to recreate here the likes of our society in its every detail, but to a smaller scale, making the book heavier and denser that it should be. She tries to treat every subject, ending up, at times, by only scratching the surface. Though, I have to applaud her for using crude language and exposing at times, something raw and dark. She does not shy away from what we all know to be the truth.All in all, I believe the author might have tried to put too much in one book and that a more thorough editing process might have solved the problem by making the book shorter and lighter. Let's all hope that this will be the case in her next book.For more on this book and other reviews, visit my blog atladybugandotherbookworms.blogspot.com",2,"03 11, 2013",1362960000,"[0, 2]"

I'm certainly aware of who she is, and I was curious about this book because she'd specifically written it for an adult audience.This book blew me away. It's a masterpiece that makes me think about Rowling in a different way. She's a brilliant writer who understands the human condition better than most contemporary writers. The fact that she can write this AND the hugely popular Harry Potter series leads me to believe she might be the most gifted writer of our time.The book is not an easy read. There are lots of characters, and she spends time with each. The result is that we understand the characters, and they seem as real (if not more real) than people who populate our own lives. Rowling is like a cynical portrait painter in the way she reveals the complexities of male and female, young and old, intelligent and simple.The plot is less important than the way the characters' decisions and motivations affect the lives of others in their small community. The book is dramatic, compelling, and satisfying if ultimately tragic.In addition, Rowling is a social commentator who paints a picture of life in the early twentieth-first century and how social structures and government policies help and hurt individuals and families. In this way, she is like Dickens and other great writers who illuminated their eras.Casual Vacancy is great literature that will be read for years to come. It's painful, smart, telling, and cruel.

"0316228532","A2MPZBHAS5VF2L","Lee","authentication fail","Does realistic equal bleak? Sometimes when reading this book I felt Rowling has something in common with her character Stuart Wall whose ""slumming it"" by seeking out ""authentic"" experiences-- such as unprotected sex with a junkie's daughter--is a reflection of his search for ""true authenticity"" - ""this, he knew, was real life."" Rowling's determination to write about real life and move beyond her roots in fantasy makes me think of a child who consciously makes herself  the polar opposite of her parents and is therefore still under their influence. Sometimes Rowling's story seems to exist only to connect the dots between every disturbing issue imaginable, and I do wonder how much firsthand experience she has with some of these issues.For instance, I may not know much about injecting heroin but I know a bit about SQL injection because I work as a web programmer, and from the descriptions of hacks used to access the council website to make defamatory posts about various characters, I got the vibe that the author was fuzzy on how hacking into a website would work, but had read a Wikipedia article about it.""It did not take very long for her to retrieve a site that gave explicit instructions for the simplest form of SQL injection. Then she brought up the Parish Council website.  It took her five minutes to hack the site, and then only because she had transcribed the code wrong the first time."" Fair enough, this character is not meant to be highly computer literate, or indeed highly intelligent, so maybe she wouldn't have thought to copy paste the code, but the ""simplest form of SQL injection"" would be something like ""'x' or -"", so not many characters to get wrong, even if she is meant to be dyslexic. And then ""to her astonishment, she discovered that whoever was administering the site had not removed the user details of The_Ghost_of_Barry_Fairbrother from the database, but merely deleted the post. It would be child's play, therefore, to post in the same name."" Um, ok I guess if the SQL injection allowed her to login she would probably end up signed in as the first person in the user table, and maybe that's likely to be the admin user, who apparently has the ability to post as any other user in the database... maybe, but pretty advanced functionality for what is supposed to be a very unsophisticated website.It may seem like I am nit-picking for the sake of it, but the description of something I know about made me wonder how realistic the other stuff was, which made Rowling's efforts to confront her audience with a barrage of bleak issues feel a bit contrived to me. Rowling is a good writer, but hopefully she can outgrow her idea that bleak equals mature, which was evident in the Harry Potter series as well as this new book for adults.",2,"11 3, 2012",1351900800,"[0, 2]"

"0316228532","A18HHKM6WGEF9D","L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","Heartbreaking and Tough But Masterful - Stick With It","There is a lot of misery in this book, and no magic. The problems the characters face - poverty, addiction, abuse, mental illness, sudden death, infidelity, and many others - are relentless and cannot be fixed by the wave of a wand. That is one takeaway from this novel, along with the truth that we are all connected, whether we like it or not, and our moments of heart, of caring, even when imperfect, are all that stands any chance of healing the wounds of the world. That sounds cliche when I write it here, but as this novel unfolds, it comes forth as a deep truth slowly revealed, and is anything but cliche.Revolving between several different characters and households in the small town of Pagford, England, at first the novel seems to revolve around a dispute on the town council regarding the future of the Fields, - a low income housing area that falls within the town's boundaries, but that many would like to have redistricted and handed back to the neighboring city of Yarvil. The sudden death of the major advocate for keeping the Fields within Pagford's boundaries sends ripples throughout the town. The lives of all the characters in the book are affected, as they each face crises brought on directly or indirectly by his death, the resulting 'casual vacancy' on the council, and the impact the council's decisions may have on each of their lives. In the end, though, this book isn't really 'about' this town dispute over the Fields, and it is never fully resolved. The book explores the various social issues relentlessly, but is hardly a treatise for one view or the other, as all the characters and their views are messy, mixed bags - it's a world of grey hues rather than black and white.It is masterfully written though. The characters and scenes are vivid, and although it does start slowly, with a dizzying number of characters to track, if you stick with it, they all become crystallized and the story carries you along. It builds to a tragic crescendo, followed by an almost quiet denouement in which there does appear to be healing and hope for some, but not all. I admit I was hoping for more of a traditional happy ending, for a more straightforward emotional payoff in the end, or at least a sense that good had triumphed over evil, but it was not to be. This novel seems determined to keep us focused on real life, and real love, and the ups and downs that occur day to day amidst it. It is nuanced, and after sitting quietly for a bit after finishing it, I found I respected that, and the emotions it had made me feel and face.In any case, you should certainly not read it because you are or are not a fan of the HP novels, as it is a wholly different kind of book. I know Rowling has focused her charitable work on underpriviliged youth, and certainly that seems to have driven part of what came forth here. But she is also such a brilliant character-driven writer (perhaps the only thing this shares with the HP books), and with this book has indisputably earned the right to not be viewed solely as either a YA or fantasy author. This book is for mature adults, and those interested in reality, unvarnished.",5,"10 8, 2012",1349654400,"[7, 9]"

""Casual Vacancy"" is a term referring to a city council seat that is empty due to a death of a council member, but symbolically it represents the moral vacancy in the lives of these characters and how their lack of morals and lack of love/compassion affects the lives of those around them. It's also about showing the layers of yourself you try to hide to make yourself appear normal or good-looking.If this were a movie, it would be RATED R for sex, domestic violence, drugs, and language. Not recommended for those under 15.It starts off slow like many 19th, early 20th century novels. It takes awhile to get to know each of the characters because there are many characters and some of them have a better second impression than first. However, once you get past the first 100-150 pages (its 503 pages total), it really picks up the pace and gets interesting.The hacked messages posted on the city council website and some people's reactions to them are pretty funny.Krystal and Robbie's stories are so moving. I cried a few times.Besides general themes like morality and mortality, and the author's name on the cover, it is completely different from Harry Potter. Even Rowling's narrative style is very different, as it should be, to reflect the different characters' personalities and also because fantasy and reality-based stories need different styles of writing. So just because you like Harry Potter doesn't mean you will like Casual Vacancy.

There was nowhere for me to hide in this book, no one individual that I clung to that I could fall back on when things got rough.  J.K.

I repeatedly asked myself how did she come back to these people and pour out their miserable souls on a daily basis, then realized that as dreary and wretched as these folks were, I kept coming back and wondered about them even when I wasn't reading.Purchasing a book is one thing and reading it through is another.

I was very excited when I downloaded my copy to my Kindle and sat down to enjoy her work. The book is a sort of parable, as JK is fond of developing stories that operate on several levels.  At its most simplistic level, its about the death of a town council member and the ripple effects that death has on the members of his small community.  On another level it is a study of the politics and infighting of small town governance.  On yet another level, its a closer look at the inner workings of relationships rife with physical and emotional abuse, and the co-dependency that fuels these dysfunctional families.  And ultimately, it is a concrete demonstration of the evil that occurs when the village has no interest in helping to raise its neglected children.  Is it a happy story?  Not really.  Is it an interesting character study?  Absolutely.  You come to understand and sympathize with the members of JK's community, some of them against your better judgement.

I was also  concerned that all the characters still alive were quite unlovable - the hero had died at the beginning.  However by the end I could see that his work might continue if not exactly as he had planned.  Overall it is a disturbing book in many ways and I couldn't get over the feeling that the author was determined to put her stamp on writing for adults in a rather heavy handed way.  I would have liked a range of characters rather than lots of unlovable ones and a very few with some saving graces.  That said, I felt that , like many of the characters who benefited from his actions, it was a pity that Barry had died early as he had obviously started to make some unhappy lives better.  Of course Pagford is really a metaphor for society  at large.  I would recommend this book to those who like serious themes, thoughtful characterisation and well written plots.

Rowling decided to to write a completely different kind of novel after her success with Harry Potter. Her first venture into the adult market has proved that she can write and entertain us in the real world as well as fantasy. I am actually not sure if I would have chosen to read this novel from the blurb had it been by an unknown author, but because it was written by J.K Rowling that was a different matter. She has always claimed that she uses real people as the basis of stories and this comes across with totally believable characters in 'The Casual Vacancy' which is an interesting bird's eye look into life in a small town in the UK, sadly probably pretty near the mark when it comes to home truths about society today! I was not surprised to read that the BBC are already planning an adaptation of the novel for television, where its realistic drama will come across well. The character development is excellent but the plot is purposely slow so it takes time and patience in your reading as you need to get to know the individuals personalities in this character driven novel.The cast of characters is indeed long but then this is a story about an entire community and how the death of Barry Fairbrother, local councillor relates to the problems, personalities and politics of the different individuals. Everyone seems to be at war with someone highlighting the prejudices that truly exist in small towns all over the country. Set in the fictional village of Pagford, the story hinges on a council election, the outcome of which will decide whether a whether a council estate called the Fields remains part of the village or becomes part of a neighbouring town. Rich versus poor, teenagers versus parents, married couples versus each other and teachers versus pupils. There is indeed plenty of anguish to keep you entertained in this 503 page novel as the inhabitants of Pagford face up to each other over this Casual Vacancy.

His unexpected passing frees up a position and this vacancy is very much a coveted one.The race for who will get the seat heats up; but the divide between those who were born and bred in Pagford and the rundown 'The Fields' (who due to a boundary mix-up should really fall under Yarvil county council's domain) grows deeper. Gossip and malicious postings on the Council page appear deepening the mistrust and resentment. As the adults cajole and mutter, some of their children individually conspire to teach their parents a lesson or just to retaliate against abuse and lack of knowledge of their own problems.With a tragic end, will the residents of Pagford learn anything as secrets and fears rapidly rise to the service shattering the illusion of a quaint English village.Rowling's outing in to the adult genre is brave and complex. The myriad characters that abound from page to page create a dysfunctional society that even with best interests at heart, they still tear each other apart leaving a wounded town. There is no main individual as such; each person met has their own problems and worries. Whilst none immediately likable, Rowling has still given them depth and huge helpings of realism. It's almost a book of contrasts. The angry teenager who really means well, with the drug addicted mother, the quiet teenager who cuts herself whose mother is the local GP. Black humor abounds as well as some moments of quintessential Britishness. The author is very expressive in both descriptions and dialogue creating a dramatic and inviting picture. She has created a story that is thought-provoking, poignant and perhaps a little bleak, but so worth the read.It took me a little while to get into this book simply because of the number of people met. Once I did, I was completely absorbed by the residents of Pagfords. There were moments of laughing out loud as well as deep sadness. I feel Rowling's new novel is such a markedly big step away from her previous books, people may feel uncomfortable or puzzled - it contains swearing, drug abuse, cutting, sex, politics - but it's these subject matters that make it a compelling read. A bold move which some say hasn't paid off, but I couldn't disagree more.

Yes, there is an interesting picture of small town life in England; yes, there is humor; but is there really a story?  In my opinion, not.  There were too many characters from the beginning and not enough of them memorable.  There was not enough of a story to catch my interest.  This is the kind of novel I actually would not voluntarily read under most circumstances -- lots of social commentary and not much interesting action.  I had to wonder -- does JKR think only kids enjoy action and suspense???I also have to comment on the writing style.  JKR used a taut style throughout the HP books, and I understand that short, tight sentences are particularly suited to juvenile fiction.  But why go entirely in the other direction and use long run-on sentences and paragraphs complete with paranthetical asides?  Halfway in-between would have been better.  I enjoy an endless sentence when written by a master like JRR Tolkien, but I'm afraid these sentences don't display the same genius.There are undoubtely people who will find this book fun to read (those who enjoy social commentary), but I found that the steep Kindle price was not justified by the product.

I almost put it down and didn't complete it before I had read 50 pages, so shocked was I by the perpetual f-bombs and vulgarities of the characters.  I honestly didn't like the book at all at first.  I'm glad I finished it, but I also told my 17 year old son that I didn't want him to read it.  It is very much a book for adults, and I'm concerned that parents will buy the book for their Potter-loving children.  It is an innocence-robbing book.Here's a theory I came up with when I was in the middle of the book.  I'm just tossing it out there.J.K. Rowling spent a decade writing about a world that Harry saved.  What if she had killed him off when Voldemort attacked him as a baby?  What would that world have then been like?  I'm proposing that here we have the non-magical answer to that question.I seriously tried to approach this book without taking the Potter series into consideration, but I found myself so longing for a hero that this is the conclusion that I came to.  Is Barry the non-magical version of Harry? (I think that the name similarity might be Freudian).  What happens in a world filled with people who are either narrow-minded or beaten down by life with no one other than themselves to pull them out?  I suggest that the Casual Vacancy is the absence of a Harry Potter.This book is not going to go down in history like the Potter books did, but I do think it has something important to say to us.  Rowling went out of her way to make us dislike the characters in this book at the beginning, but we gradually come to know them and I did come to feel empathy for many of them (not ALL of them!).  It is very much a book about class warfare, how unhealthy learned behaviors affect others, and the generation gap.  It does NOT have a happy ending.  I'm not sure how many of the characters experience positive growth in the story.  Rather than being a book in which characters we look up to uplift us, it is a book that seeks to have us understand those who may not be as fortunate as we.  What can we do to improve their lot?  How can we differentiate ourselves from the middle class folk in this book who treat the less fortunate with condescension and contempt?  The book made me take a hard look at myself.  Hence the 4 star review.  If you are an open minded adult reader, give it a chance.  FINISH IT!",4,"10 5, 2012",1349395200,"[5, 9]"

"0316228532","A3QGKB7LL0BOPD","Littleprobie","Perfect","I've been waiting for a book to sweep me off my feet and consume me for months and I honestly didn't think this would be the one to do it. I understand there have been mixed reviews about Rowling's first offering to adults and thought it may take a while for her to get into a rhythm but I was wrong.From page one I was transported back to the small village and bordering town I was raised in in Cornwall, England. Rowling has perfectly encapsulated the small minded nature of small communities and intertwined it with the cataclysmic events which happen in people's, seemingly normal, everyday lives.Firstly I will address the two things which I found challenging/frustrating about the book1) the number of characters. Be warned. There are lots of characters and you get to hear from their perspectives regularly. I stopped halfway through the book and made a character map to get my head straight. I would recommend you do this too, especially if you are having to pick the book up and put it down regularly (I had the luxury of bring able to read this in 4 days). I want to note, however, that, upon reflection on finishing the book, I would not remove one character. They all interwove seamlessly to make this the richly, rewarding novel that it is.2) overuse of the words perennial and perennially!  I'll overlook that though!!Rowling uses multiple narratives to question your thinking at every turn. The moment you begin to feel empathy or dislike for one of the characters she turns it on its head and shows you another person's point of view so effortlessly you don't realise its happening. You find yourself battling its your own morals and beliefs and reflecting on your own life and those in it. She explores perfectly so many demographics of society. She was able narrate from (to name but a few) the perspective of teenagers, a junkie mother, pompous middle class women, a single, lonely mother and, not once, did she let the ball drop. Not once did I think to myself 'Gavin wouldn't have done that' or 'Sukhvindef wouldn't do this'. When I read reviews where people said they didn't like once character I find that hard to understand. I found myself liking different characters, at different times, for different reasons-very much like real life. I did feel the most likeable characters, for me, did end up being the underdogs.Rowliing really challenges the way we all think are lead to think and let ourselves think about others.  From the do-gooder busy bodies in the village, who everyone loves to hate, to the people from the 'fields' she quickly brings to life a split society. Rowling guides us through the reasons for people's behaviours and place in life, which we so often chose to overlook, such as rape, incest, drug abuse, domestic violence, self harm, bullying, affairs and navigates us through the journeys of those experiencing these situations so fully and convincingly you can almost feel their pain,anguish, shame, hurt, hope, lust and disappointment.This book is not anything like the Harry Potter series, nor does it claim to be, but I think a lot of the more negative reviews may come from people wanting a faster pace ,like that of her previous work.  The Casual Vacancy is slow and thoughtful but that's because it's so beautifully constructed making it such a moving, well rounded novel. It is a book, however, which may be difficult to read for 20 minutes a night unless you are very good at remembering characters, links etc. so treat it as a special book. Set time aside over a holiday, long weekend and lose yourself.Please pick this book up. Especially if you grew up in Britain I will be surprised if this doesn't get to your very core and, like me, leave me feeling lost and sad that I have finished it.",5,"12 18, 2012",1355788800,"[2, 3]"

She weaves the world, and the interrelationships between the ?34 characters in a skillful way. The book, I believe, is a very detailied, sore, dirty look at who we really are as human beings.The story is not an action packed light read. To appreciate the plot you must slowly get to know the characters and their world and watch how they move the plot forward in a mess of emotions, hurts, failed lives and attempts to control their own little worlds.What is so amazing about this book, if you give it the time it needs, is that every character presents themselves as they see themselves, but then you flip point of view to see them from the perspective of others they interact with and suddenly a virtue is now the bane of someone else's life. What might be a cursed person as seen by one chartacter, may be seen by someone else as a heroic attempts at being good and a great effort rise above their burdened lives..This story reminds me of the film Magnolia, with Tom Cruise.

As the deadline for the novel's release crept closer, I finally buckled down and decided I would read it (although I'm super annoyed at the ridiculously expensive Kindle price for the book).Before you even read the book, if you are expecting a happy-go-lucky Rowling, you will be disappointed.  I made the conscious decision that as I read the book, I would not think of my Harry Potter author, but of a new author instead.  I believe that pretending she wasn't the author seems kind of strange, but it could have been beneficial to my enjoyment as I read.In ""The Casual Vacancy"" by J.K. Rowling, we are just introduced to Barry Fairbrother, when he drops down dead at the golf club restaurant in the small town of Pagford, England. The town erupts into a gossipy mess, struggling amongst themselves to determine who can fill Barry's position on the Parish Council.  The town is divided in this aspect, between two factions with opposite ideals for The Fields, a neighborhood filled with people on public assistance.""The Casual Vacancy"" is a darker novel, with scenes involving sex, drugs, physical and sexual abuse, self-harm, and gossipy townspeople.While I enjoyed the novel, I'm not sure if it's a must-read.  This is a tough review for me to write because I think the book was good, kept me interested, and was an interesting way for Rowling to come out as an adult writer.Should you read it?  I think you should.  Will you love it and recommend it to everyone you know?  Probably not.  I'm left feeling not crazy excited about it, but not disliking it either.

Thus, my expectations were high for the author's move to adult characters.  I purchased the book at the Philadelphia Airport before flying to a rural destination for four days knowing I would have much time with little or nothing to do.  My first criticism is that she introduces way too many characters in the first few pages and we are supposed to keep these people--parents and their children--separated one from the other.  To complicate this process, she alternates from using their given names and their nicknames.  Unlike War and Peace, there is no list to help the reader remember who the characters are.  I had nothing else to read otherwise I probably would have given up after 50+ pages.  All of the characters keep returning over and over so one does not feel that some are important and some not.

The Harry Potter books will forever be part of our culture. So, with that series ended, Rowling's announcement that she was writing an adult novel was greeted with much (much!) anticipation.And with it's publication - much scrutiny. As a fan of the Potter books, I had to read The Casual Vacancy.""6.11  A casual vacancy is deemed to have occurred :(a)  when a local councillor fails to make his declaration of acceptance of office within the proper time; or(b) when his notice of resignation is received';or(c) on the day of his death...""And in the parish of Pagford, England, it's option (c) when councillor Barry Fairbrother unexpectedly dies. The local council is warring amongst themselves. The issue? Who should be responsible for the local estate - referred to as The Fields. Should it be Pagford or neighbouring city of Yarvil. This vacancy offers up the chance to turn the tide for one side or the other...the race is on to fill the seat....'Both, as they watched....were contemplating the casual vacancy: and they saw it not as an empty space but as a magician's pocket, full of possibilities.""Rowling rapidly introduces us to a plethora of characters. Each is well-drawn and provided me with  vivid mental images. Inthe beginning I did have to make myself a reference list of characters and their relationships until I had a firm grasp of who was who.The Casual Vacancy is driven by it's characters. Most of them are not nice people. But it's an interesting social commentary. The 'better-offs' in Pagford are quite sure they are above those 'lower classes' living in The Fields. But our behind the scenes view allows us to see that they are no different from each other. The Pagfordians are just more polite about it.The Casual Vacancy is not a small book - it's five hundred pages long. Although I'm a voracious reader, it took me almost two weeks to finish. Why? Well, packed into that five hundred pages is a lot of pettiness, bullying, selfishness, cruelty, vindictiveness, conniving, scheming...you get the picture. And it made me sad, just really sad. I really didn't get much enjoyment from reading this book. But I soldiered on, determined to see what happened at the end. Which I didn't like. The one character I enjoyed met a depressing fate.Rowling's writing is impeccable, the town and the machinations of it's inhabitants are all part of a tightly woven plot and her characterizations are spot on. So it's going to be a very hard book to rate for me. The writing is a four, but my enjoyment was only a three, so I'll go with 3.5/5.The Casual Vacancy is definitely an adult novel, with lots of profanity, drug use, self harm, sexual situations and more.",3,"10 29, 2012",1351468800,"[1, 1]"

This was one of those books where I was immediately hooked, then lost interest for a while in the middle, and then got hooked again. There is a lot of back and forth and you have no clue how the story will end.And boy o boy, there is a lot to keep track of! The story follows a community's reaction to the untimely death of Barry Fairbrother, one of Pagford's councillors. As the story progresses the townspeople's different ""hidden agendas"" come to life. The story is viewed through about 20 of Pagford's citizen's eyes and sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's who, and who has biases against whom and so on and so forth. The good thing is that most of these characters are relateable on some level and the other ones? Well they're just fun to hate :)Part of me was disappointed that this was not Harry Potter, I know, I know, she's trying to break away from that and do her own thing, but it's soo new to me. One good thing is that her writing style is still the same and her words still have a magical, flowing quality about them.Overall, this book was different from anything I have read in a long long time. The concept may sound kind of droll (who cares about a small English town?) but it hooks you regardless and Rowling keeps you guessing til the very end. Who will fill Barry's seat on council? Will his agenda be dropped? Who is spilling Pagford's darkest secrets?This is one of those books that everyone is reading and you need to be in the know. So read it!

"0316228532","A378VSY197HUNT","Mad","real, raw, tragic, and nothing like Harry Potter","Another review here from someone who has actually read the whole book. And I do feel like I should offer some sort of disclaimer here- I am a huge Harry Potter fan and grew up with the books. However, Harry Potter has not blinkered my reading career, as much as I loved the books, I love other books more and am currently doing my literature degree at university. I feel like this is important to mention because whilst J.K Rowling's name drew me to the book in the first place, it is not what made me read it and not what made me enjoy it.Truthfully, I think the publication of The Casual Vacancy is rather brave, because this is a book that will polarize readers. It is absolutely nothing like Harry Potter and it is absolutely not for anyone under the age of 15, minimum. Readers wanting puppies, kittens and magic spells should really look elsewhere because this is grim, stark reality. It reminded me far more of Christos Tsiolkas' award winning The Slap than anything else, both books have catalyst events that pave the way for the action of the novel and changing lives of cast of characters, who share the role of protagonist. Also like The Slap, and like much of the work of many great writers, The Casual Vacancy is a form of social inquiry. Rowling is deftly weaving her story around societal issues, problems of class, politics, family, small town life and, at its very heart, human nature.For the first part of the book I found the rapidly changing perspectives rather confusing, simply because there were so many characters to keep track of, I found myself mentally going through a roster in order to work out exactly who was who. Of course, this did not last and by the end of the novel each character had a distinctive voice, personality and story arch that I remembered and enjoyed. At times it also verges on preachy as Rowling shows us SO many problems at once and her voice breaks through the story which is distracting and annoying, but it doesn't happen often.I found it a fast read, I couldn't put it down and finished in under a day, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The book is gritty and ultimately tragic but it is also full of humour and whilst Rowling reveals her characters' abundant flaws, they are also sympathetic and relatable. They come across as real people trying to survive and live, warts and all. From smug, aspirational and distinctly Dursley-like Howard and Shirley Mollison, to humorless Kay and rebellious Fats ... these are people you will recognize. There is no immediate hero to latch onto (though my favourites were Sukhvinda, Krystal and- surprisingly- Samantha) and the reader is forced to understand the characters as three dimensional, flawed, real people.This book made me cry because it is real, the ultimate problem of the book is, as the author said `What do we do about Krystal?' the ultimate tragedy of the book is that embroiled in politics, small town life, self consciousness and hubris- no one does enough.  This is an honest book and it's a big issue book. It has a lot to say about the problems of our affluent societies and the human condition.I take my hat off to you J.K Rowling because this was an excellent book. It's not Harry Potter, it's a literary novel. People are either going to love it or hate it. It's going to get a lot of negative reviews. It's not going to change the world, it's not a masterpiece.

I read the book and listened to it on playaway. Okay, I have never read Harry Potter, therefore I really didn't have any particular expectation about Rowling's writing style. I expected the writing to be decent and when it exceeded that expectation, I was glad. I enjoyed the layers that each character had, and the fact that I could clearly visualize each character as a full fledged individual and not a cardboard cutout.Also, even though the setting and dialect/colloquial terms are completely different from where I live, I found myself being reminded of situations and people that I have met. I found myself thinking upon the different experiences that I have had as a teen, and comparing those to what is in the book. I think I almost cried when Rowling described Sukhvinder's situation. Yes, it wasn't the worst, but her story struck a cord with me.And, there are multiple perspectives to choose from when reading this book.I usually find myself having to flip back and forth through the pages to figure out who the heck is being referenced.

"0316228532","A12DY8SIJI0WR9","Margery L. Goldstein","A well-constructed, well-written, but dark book","This dark but engaging novel has one thing (at least) in common with the Harry Potter books: it deals at length with the disconnect between the actual lives of teenagers and how those teenagers are seen by their parents. The teens in the village of Pagford are not magical, but they do have a power their parents don't recognize: they are comfortable with computers. One after another, they hack into the parish council website to wreak havoc with their parents' lives and reputations.Ms Rowling is an astute observer of the lives of teens, whom she depicts with sympathy and depth. The lives of her adult characters are interesting but somewhat less deeply examined. She does a wonderful job, though, of presenting from everyone's perspective the life of the man whose sudden death at the beginning of the novel precipitates the action.I enjoyed reading The Casual Vacancy. It was long but well-paced, looping through its largish cast of characters and perspectives with confidence and clarity. The chapters, scenes, and sentences were well-constructed, with some beautiful descriptions. Rowling used some dialect to indicate class distinctions but no regional expressions or pronunciations that would indicate where in England the story takes place. (At least, the reader was not tripping over ""innit"" all the time, as in some English books.)Rowling's take on the human condition is, on the whole, more compassionate than caustic, but she does not seem hopeful that the enormous burden of class disparity is going to lift from English society any time soon. One of her teenage characters is preoccupied with the idea of living an ""authentic"" life.

I did not purchase this book because I was a fan of the author.  The Harry Potter series doesn't interest me, and from the reviews I read before buying this book, the author completely deviated from her norm here.  That being said, this book had its moments.  All in all, it was very good, albeit depressing, however, it was steeped in reality.  The author excels at making you feel for the characters, some good, some bad, some downright pathetic.  The reasons I did not give it 5 stars were twofold: first, there was a point about midway through the book where it dragged a little and I started to lose interest, but it did pick up and the ending was very fast-paced.  I couldn't wait to finish it to find out what happened to the characters. Secondly, there were so many characters that there were times it was hard to keep track of them (especially on my Kindle; it's much easier to flip back to a pages in a book when you need to go back and check on something).  I would definitely read other books by this author, but not any Harry Potters.",4,"01 1, 2013",1356998400,"[0, 0]"

It was an amazing story of a whole town and instead of learning about just one person you got to learn about all the different people who made the town and how it came together. Yes it was sad, but it looked at the town in a whole new perspective. In the beginning of the book J.K Rowling introduces a lot of different people, but that isn't any different from Agatha Christie, and Joyce Carol Oates. They both introduce a lot of people in their novels as well, and it does make it hard to get everyone straight at first. I will admit that I was going back and finding the initial introduction to make sure that I had the right person but afterwards I found this book to be wonderful.I loved learning about each of the individual people and their back story and how it all came together at the end. If you are looking for a book that is out of the box, and not your normal story then I would recommend this. I think it would be hard if you had to put it down and pick it back up with all of the different people involved. Once I started this book I couldn't put it down, and I loved every page of this story. It was sad, and there were people who you felt terrible for but you also felt that you were part of the town. And you were a bystander as everyone else was moving around you.Give this book a try, you might be surprised that once you get into the thick of the story you wont want it to end.

Very many people who read this book grew up in very similar communities like this village. And for that I think that's why it's so hard to get through. Because this book looks at the hard facts. The book doesn't have a clear good and evil side like the Harry Potter series did, mostly because life isn't divided up into 'Good' or 'Bad'. For that reason this book is hard to get through.But once you get into it, you invest yourselves into these characters. You want So-And-So to win the election and you want So-and-So to get a stick shoved up his ass (Opps, minor spoiler). These people might as well be your neighbors. I walked away from this book wanting to rant about how awful some of these characters were. I wanted to step in and save some of these characters. I wanted Krystal to have a better life and come hang out with me where she and her brother would be safe (Opps, more spoilers). This novel is a beautiful study of the human condition.

I got around 30 pages in when I put it down and decided it was boring. I can look back now, and honestly say, that I probably was not giving it the proper attention that was necessary.You see, picking it up and reading it properly this time, I can see why I (and I assume many of the lower scored reviews), dismiss this book. There are about 17 main characters, and their points of views shift constantly, hardly ever staying on one character too long. On the 2nd read (which should be considered my only true reading of this book), this frustrated me to no end! At least at first. About a 100 pages in, every time I felt like I had a good grip on who was related to who and what they did, I got mixed up again and scolded myself for it. Then, because I'm so terrible with names, even in real life, I just wrote down all the characters and their family relations on a sheet of paper. I felt silly doing it, but I'm sure glad I did it.After I had the names down, this book became worlds better. It really is fantastic. JK Rowling sure has a knack for bringing characters to life with her words and making them multi dimensional. I think that may be another reason why people dislike this book. Everyone has things about them that are admirable, but they also have lots of horrible sides to them that can make a lot of them seem like a-holes. But that's what real about them. They're great. They're multi faceted. They have reasons for everything they do.The more you get used to the names and all, the better the book gets. In classic Rowling fashion, the last 100 pages are so crescendo with excitement filled, page-turning, awesomeness. I'm always in awe of her writing when I finish a book. She always managed to wrap everything up nearly flawlessly.This book should have been reviewed a lot better than it was. I think a lot of people had preconceptions of what it should be. And it's not that. It's an adult book, totally and completely. The themes are heavy and dark. Really almost too dark, (at times). The characters are gritty. The story isn't overly grand or epic. It's about a simple small town.Overall, Casual Vacancy is one of the better books I've read in a while and I truly enjoyed it. The last 100 pages or so had me tempted to review it as a ""5-star"", but I think it's a little closer to 4. Though, I wouldn't be surprised if it grew in my head over time into a 5.Check it out, but try and give it a fair shot.",4,"07 31, 2013",1375228800,"[1, 1]"

The swirl of characters at the beginning is appropriately, realistically confusing. Their names and associations make the reader dizzy like a person who has lost, in an instant, the ground on which a most-beloved partner in life stood; she cannot identify any voices surrounding her.Even the title, The Casual Vacancy, fits the insult, the trivialization brought by death mocking lives lost so quickly and easily--so casually--yet so stunningly, permanently. Many readers will not know what deep truth Rowling offers us. But those of us who do--appreciate the telling. It makes us a little less insane.Adult readers of the Harry Potter series will appreciate the detail, depth, and ultimate connectedness-of-everything that Rowling writes. She is an amazing writer.

Don't we all just love JKR so much?","It was never a question of whether or not I would read J.K. Rowling's first novel since the Harry Potter series, and her first book for adults. Obviously I would read it. I've been a huge fan of Rowling's writing and storytelling for well over a decade, reading and re-reading the Harry Potter books more often than I have any other book (let alone series of books). She's been a big part of my reading life for years. Obviously I would read anything she writes. As some reviewers have said, she's ""review-proof."" I, like so many others, would read her work no matter what. The question is, could I write an honest review?Well...The Casual Vacancy is not a book you can (or should) compare to Rowling's other work. It has nothing to do with Harry Potter, in subject matter or in tone. If anything, it's sort of a glimpse into the inner life of the Dursleys, but even that's a stretch. It's a book about class struggles and politics in rural England centred around the election of a new member of the Parish Council. I expected it to be funny, even in a dry British kind of way (I'm assuming I don't need to explain what I mean by that). About half-way through I thought maybe it was meant to be more sad or at least poignant and revealing of the human condition. The thing is...Okay, I have to pause here to distance myself from what I'm about to say. I'm having a hard time admitting that I didn't love the book written by the author whose other books I obsessively loved. And it's not even that I didn't love it as much as Harry Potter, or that it wasn't as good as I thought it would be, or that it was different from what I expected.

But when council member Barry Fairbrother, well-liked and respected, dies of a stroke in his early forties, the town is left in shock. It's also left with a plethora of candidates ready to fill his vacant seat, and that's when the fun, or the trouble, begins. Because the inhabitants of this little town, so warm and friendly to all appearances, have deep-seated resentments and agendas--rich hate poor, teenagers defy their parents, husbands and wives disagree violently, and teachers despair of ever teaching their students anything! This ia a black comedy, well-written and amusing, and if you admire J. K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame, you'll probably like this book, her first adult novel.

"0316228532","A319KYEIAZ3SON","Mary Whipple","""You think reality is up for negotiation, that we think it's whatever you say it is...You must accept that you are not God.""","(2.5 stars) Focusing on life in the very small community of Pagford, perhaps similar to the small communities Rowling herself knew as a child in Gloucestershire, Rowling emphasizes the pettiness, the rivalries, the back-biting, and the cruelties of ""ordinary"" life as people try to cope with the messiness of existence as it unfolds. There is no magic here to offer any hope of change, no wizard to sweep down and offer aid, either to the characters or to the reader, and as the action progresses, with its focus on the unpleasant and often violent aspects of many lives, the reader is forced to examine the elements of chance which can devastate everything that one might dream of.Barry Fairbrother, a banker in his early forties, dies of an undiagnosed aneurism at the outset of the novel, a victim of a genetic defect. He leaves behind a wife and four children- and creates a ""casual vacancy"" on the Parish Council, which governs the community. Sixteen Council members deal with a variety of community issues, including the proposal to separate an area of Pagford called the Fields from the rest of this picturesque community and make it the responsibility of Yarvil, the more industrialized community which is its neighbor. A second issue involves the closure of a drug rehab facility located near the Fields, from which most of its clients are drawn. These clients are a financial and social burden for Pagford, since they vandalize bus stations, streetlights, footpaths and public seating, all of which must be maintained by Pagford. Inhabiting low-cost housing, these residents are also viewed as belonging to a completely different social class - lower economic level, less education, less sense of social responsibility, and somehow less worthy of the efforts by Pagford's citizens.Rowling introduces over thirty characters in the first fifty pages of the book, providing enough brief but specific descriptions for each character to participate in the plot, which quickly unfolds on several levels of simultaneous conflict. Husbands and wives fight, spouses fight with their lovers, children and parents fight, teenagers fight with each other (sometimes resorting to bullying on the internet), teenagers fight with teachers, and two children fight simply for survival. The issues relating to the ""casual vacancy"" on the Council create even more conflict.The style which was so effective for Rowling when she was writing Harry Potter is less effective in this ""adult"" novel. Some characters are memorable for some aspects of their characters without being unique, while on the level of plot, the conflicts and crises, based on real life, are already familiar to devoted readers of contemporary fiction and often feel trite. At five hundred pages, this novel gave Rowling many opportunities to introduce broad themes and develop them with sophistication and attention to universal values. Instead, she gives us a long novel which is sometimes exciting on the limited level of plot, but which remains on that limited level, never soaring into broader realms of wider scope. The characters here sometimes feel like paper dolls, limited by their rather stereotyped depictions, while their sheer numbers prevent the author from developing subtleties that make them come alive. What starts in Pagford stays in Pagford, unfortunately.",3,"09 29, 2012",1348876800,"[12, 18]"

However, I love to read books from many genres, and I was very well aware that ""The Casual Vacancy"" was J.K. Rowling's foray into a whole new world. I wasn't expecting wizards or magic or broomsticks or even humor. What I was expecting was a novel that wasn't super dull to read, and unfortunately  for me, that's exactly what ""The Casual Vacancy"" is, from start to finish: boring, boring, boring. And my goodness, how it DRAGS! Rowling's extremely vivid descriptions and characterizations were apparent in this book, but the problem is that all of the characters are basically selfish and one-dimensional, not to mention completely uninteresting. This book paints a dark picture of the lives of the residents who inhabit a small English town and come to blows over its politics, but there's nothing for the reader to really grab onto or care about, and the pacing of the story is unbelievably slow, especially for the first half of the book.I don't think it's fair to call this a BAD book, but its certainly one that I thought I'd enjoy much more than I did. Some reviewers are aghast because of the sex scenes, foul language, and other adult material depicted in this book. None of that bothered me in the least.

"0316228532","A1ZVE45I4EON6G","MelS","A grim and shocking representation of life - but a good book","I'd like to write this review with the focus off the famous name behind it, but on the actual book itself.The Casual Vacancy is not light reading. It's not just the sheer number of pages the reader is faced with, but a daunting amount of characters to keep track of.  There are well over a dozen inhabitants of the small town of Pagford which this book focuses on.  It does take a long time to work out who is connected to whom, and why you should care about them. This book is also uncomfortably wordy - as if more mundane words and descriptions were gone over with a thesaurus, and the most complex and foreign synonym put in its place.There is no riveting plot that drives this story; the focus is on the characters - their thoughts, actions, motivations. This is probably the hardest aspect of this book to grasp, simply because none of these characters are positive or endearing in any way.  For shock value, these characters are posed as everyday people, regular town inhabitants and community members - teenagers, parents, doctors, lawyers.  Any redeeming characteristics are thrown in at the end of the book, presumably to tie up loose ends, however it is far too little, far, far too late.  Don't forget you've already sat through 500 pages of these people's everyday thoughts, which are astonishingly vulgar, hateful and usually illegal. However, while these characters alone should be enough to put you off this story, it is crafted in a way that you have to keep reading. You want to know what happens to them, despite none of them deserving a happy ending.The Casual Vacancy shows us that there are those who believe they are better than others, and how at the end of the day, they really and truly aren't.  This book puts heroin junkies and prostitutes (and their children) next to so-called upstanding citizens of a community and shows that they aren't so different after all. It looks at people who choose to put themselves up to speak on behalf of a community, and asks why they have that right to. It's pretty grim and depressing. Along the way, we meet a plethora of shocking and unfavourable topics: self-mutilation, domestic violence, rape, heroin addiction, adultery, suicide.  In fact, there's probably very little Rowling hasn't covered.There is no doubt that The Casual Vacancy is an extremely well-written book.  Despite its dark and un-likeable characters and themes, they will stick with you long after you've turned the last page.  Their thoughts and motivations often have you questioning your own. I found the amount of displeasing and adult-oriented topics this book touched on a bit gratuitous and unnecessary, but it has the desired effect I suspect the author was looking for.  No, it's not light-hearted or even enjoyable, and the characters don't have the same light and dark side so generously given to this author's famous previous characters, but that's no reason why you shouldn't read this hard and shocking portrayal of human society.",4,"03 27, 2013",1364342400,"[2, 3]"

Unfortunately, I was wrong.I found this book to be incredibly boring. I had to literally force myself to read it, and even stopped and read other books between some sections because reading The Casual Vacancy was more punishment than joy. The story itself is pretty simple, people trying to fill a spot on the local council left by the death of a member. The problem is that the book is overlong with characters thinking the same things over & over (having to repeatedly read Colin Wall's ridiculous thoughts drove me crazy), I didn't find a single character likeable & apparently, this town attracts every bad parent in the area. Even when a tragedy occurs, it's completely expected & means nothing, I wasn't interested enough in the characters involved to care. I've heard this book being described as a dark comedy. I get the dark, but where was the comedy?

Over time I've adjusted to the rare $12.99. But after reading a couple of positive professional reviews and becoming immersed in the sample, I bit, even at the publisher's ridiculous price of $17.99 (as I write).Hard to say that ""The Casual Vacancy"" was a treat, because the story characters are so mean or dysfunctional or drab, their relationships and self-involvements are so warped, yet the atmosphere created by Rowling of Pagford, an otherwise charming English village, is so rich and layered that it was a wicked joy to read.The characters would have been cartoon-like if they were one-dimensional, but they weren't. The situations would have been comical, except these things do happen, people do act in these ways, these kinds of petty slights, spites and horrific tragedies do exist.

I sturggled along hoping to find a protagonist I could get behind and cheer for; yet, I continue to discover more and more scenes that made me like the characters less and less. Characters use each other without remorse or a moral compass, there are scenes after scenes of physical abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, profanity, and rape that you just feel dirty. Even the children in this book are without moral fiber. In truth the only reason I made it to page 350 is because this book was written by J.K. Rowlings. Yes, the book is well written but that does not matter when there is nothing else to recommend it.I will not recap the storyline because the book summary accomplishes providing the prospective reader with the overall idea; however, this is not a mystery but rather a trip into depravity.

There are more messed up teens and parents in this small town than seems humanly possible. If that's the point that everyone is a hypocrite and has a hidden agenda, then she made that point well. That being said, the writing was sharp, the intertwined lives of the characters well conceived, the depiction of the town was vivid, but I found that I had to will myself to finish the book, mostly because there are really no sympathetic characters in the whole lot of them. You end up alternating between feelings of intense dislike mixed with pity for most of the characters and that fact kept me from really enjoying the book. I feel like I survived a 3 day ordeal just by finishing. My conclusion is that JK Rowling is a very perceptive writer with a sharp grasp of people's character flaws, but deep down I wished she'd touched upon some redeeming features of humanity. I felt like I needed a shower after finishing this book. Sure, she brings up many important social issues but you have to prepare yourself for a bleak few hundred pages.

"0316228532","A5XTKUF2E7LTF","Michael Scott","Painful","I tried my best to put Harry Potter out of mind when reading Casual Vacancy, trying to let it stand on its own without any baggage or expectations; yet the book is powerfully influenced by the Harry Potter legacy, in that Rowling -- now writing a novel purely for the adult audience -- is able to do all the things a decade of writing ""all ages"" novels precluded her from doing.So the book is filled from its early pages with swearing and sex and awful people wreaking horrible emotional, and sometimes physical, havoc on each other, described in ten-dollar words when a two-dollar would do fine. I'm not opposed in the slightest to ""bad"" words or sexuality in literature, nor do large words inherently put me off, but Rowling seems to do these things less because they're warranted in the story being told and more just to show she can. Ironically, her attempts to prove herself an author capable of more mature fare -- if that's indeed what happened here -- have resulted in a considerably less mature novel than the children's series for which she is so renowned. It comes off less as the work of a literary giant wielding a mastery of the craft, and more a teenage girl at a strict countryside high school scrawling swear words and smutty doodles in her notebook, relishing the naughtiness in her acts of petty rebellion.The story might have been more enjoyable had it been more satirical, juxtaposing a stuffy, pompous Britishness of the characters with their small, mean inequities for some dark humor. But at no point does the novel allow the prim and proper facade to gain any traction, immediately and constantly calling it out for its hypocrisy, usually by jumping (sometimes a bit too quickly) from one point of view character to another as they all quietly despise each other. Lacking satirical bite, the venom-soaked proceedings are simply unpleasant to read.If this book has any redeeming value, let's hope it's that Rowling has purged herself of all this pent-up, unnecessary vulgarity, and that her next book will be less insecure, more balanced, and above all else, something enjoyable to read again.",2,"12 25, 2012",1356393600,"[2, 4]"

There were two main things that made this book difficult for me to stick with. First, the characters are not very likeable at all.  They ranged from annoying to pathetic to downright repellent.  Second, I just couldn't get myself to care about the whole plot with the election and the Fields issue.Well, my 14-day library loan was coming to a close and I was only halfway through, so I tried to finish quickly (a bit of skimming here and there...) and finally, I started to enjoy the book... a little.

Conflicts that have been simmering under the surface for years come to a head with the unexpected death of a councilman, leading to a &#34;casual vacancy&#34; on the council. The factions on the council are divided over the perceived drain on resources by the subsidized housing community (the Fields) just outside of the town. Whereas Barry, the deceased man, rose from poverty in the Fields to a comfortable middle class experience, others are convinced that is a blight on their community. At the center of the story is Krystal, a kind of anti-heroine, a teenager trying to take care of her toddler brother and her in and out of rehab for heroin mother. She had been taken under Barry's wing as a member of the rowing team. While far from an angel, Krystal has a tragic air of trying to do the right thing but failing despite her good intentions. As the politics become nastier, we see how the families are affected and how small things can erupt into terrible consequences. While I agree with some of the other reviewers that the dark and gritty nature of the novel can sometimes be over the top and is certainly a big departure from the Harry Potter series, it is a shot of reality, and you can see Rowling's depth of character development and storytelling in spite of the modern and &#34;real&#34; tone.

But it didn't work out that way.I almost put it down at 50 pages, and not picked it back up again -- something that's rare for me.  At 100 pages, I still could not have told you who or what the book was about.  But, largely due to the author's reputation, I kept going.It did get more interesting.  It also got darker and darker; it really sucks the joy out of you.The book begins with several pages on each of the 16 or so ""main"" characters.  It jumps back and forth, presumably establishing each one.  But it seemed very disjointed.  Repeatedly, I had to go back and check which character was which (through the first 75 to 100 pages) because the constant jumping around made it hard for me to remember who was who.  In addition, it was constantly jumping between the world of adults and the world of teenagers.  It's a bit jarring to move from small town council business to who's got a crush on who at the high school.There was a key event involving the hacking of a website that finally put a plot in motion. At that point, it was almost compelling to read.  But as it moved forward, the characters' thoughts and emotions became darker and darker, and the book became bleaker and bleaker.In many ways, the book is about social class, community, and responsibility.  Rowling is certainly well positioned to write about that, having moved from being a struggling single mom who needed some help from the government to one of the wealthiest women on earth.  She is able to illustrate the views each class has of another, and why.  That is perhaps the book's primary achievement.But, since it's a book about an abstract thing, rather than about a character, it's challenging to make this work.  Steinbeck wrote a more successful book of this sort in The Grapes of Wrath.  The image of Tom Joad has stayed with me since I read it in the 1990s.

She's got death, cheating, cutting, masturbation, child and spouse abuse, drug abuse, twisted marriages, twisted sex, bullying, crime, and so much profanity it's like reading a jail-house conversation.I am so mad I bought this book!

"0316228532","A3QITRGT87L14M","Miss Stubbs ""ThiefofCamorr""","bit hard to read for how &#8216;real&#8217; and depressing it is, but fantastic overall","&#8216;The Casual Vacancy&#8217; by J. K. Rowling is a contemporary piece of literature, seasoned with a dash of &#8211; well, people seem to be saying mystery, but I hesitantly don&#8217;t agree. I simply see it as a harsh view on society that isn&#8217;t exactly nice to read, but would have to agree that more spotlight probably needs to be shown on such areas. I have the feeling that the style of life shown within this book is more prevalent than many of us would like to think on.Barry Fairbrother dies within the first few pages &#8211; the rest of the book shows those who knew and interacted with him trying to deal with the aftermath. While their little village of Padford seems quaint with its cobbled marketplace and ancient abbey, what really exists beyond this visual is failing marriages, mentally unwell adults and children, domestic abuse, drug use and so on.The book is named because Barry Fairbrother owned a seat on the parish council, and it: &#8216;is a situation in which a seat in a deliberative assembly is vacated during that assembly&#8217;s term. Casual vacancies arise through the death, resignation or disqualification of the sitting member.&#8217;The council is currently divided and Barry was a well-loved representative known for his stance on helping those who live in &#8216;the Fields&#8217; (where the poor and those living on council benefits mostly live). Those against him are jubilant in the hopes they&#8217;ll be able to replace him with someone on their side, so they can move jurisdiction of &#8216;the Fields&#8217; to the neighbouring city, and get rid of the addiction clinic which to them is seen as a drain of money.Hereon we see those who supported and worked against Barry, their families and those who are affected even in the smallest way by his passing.While at times I felt a little confusion at how many characters there are (and who they&#8217;re related and interacting with, and whether they&#8217;re the one that steals or the one that&#8217;s currently avoiding that girl or deputy at the school &#8211; it was good in that J. K. managed to get a lot about the characters conveyed to the reader with a minimal amount of dialogue or backstory. Her description is akin to that in her Harry Potter series, yet that&#8217;s virtually it. There&#8217;s no holding back with the drug and sex scenes, nor with the domestic abuse, so yes, this is a book for adults &#8211; anyone who wants to read it because they loved Harry Potter would probably be disappointed, as there&#8217;s really no connection at all between the two.The characters are almost like those in the movie &#8216;Love Actually&#8217;, how a character you see interact with a few characters here, then appears over here also with these other few characters. It takes the otherwise almost simply plot and turns it thick, fast moving yet detailed, and an added depth exists because of the nature of the plot, and the lives that are at stake.I didn&#8217;t cry at the ending (as J. K. said she did) but I will say that the character it ends with was my favourite for reasons I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on. While all characters in this are uncompromisingly desperate for their own &#8216;win&#8217; or survival, she is perhaps the most desperate.If I had to compare it to anything, I would compare it to that of &#8216;Stonemouth&#8217; by Iain Banks, for the bleak view of the world, the small village and the misery within.I have no negatives about the book. It was very heavy, quite sad in parts, and a bit hard to read for how &#8216;real&#8217; and depressing it was, but it told a good story. Some characters were uncomfortably recognisable, but mostly I felt glad to live where I do, in the family structure I do, with the friends, work place and colleagues that I do.",5,"06 26, 2014",1403740800,"[0, 0]"

Jacobsen ""I am not young enough to know ev...","Rowling proves she is a first-rate storyteller","It took me a good six months to get through this book because I chose to listen to the audiobook instead of reading it.  With kids around, I found it difficult to find time where I could turn on the book and listen, lol.  As you're probably aware, this is JK Rowling's first ""adult"" novel.  (Personally, I think more adults than kids loved her Harry Potter series, but since everyone insists on categorizing them Young Adult, who am I to argue?)The story takes place in a small rural English town where we immediately learn that a member of the town council has died of a heart attack, leaving what is known as a ""casual vacancy.""  As they story progresses, we learn more than we probably wanted to know about the various folk in this town, some of whom are vying for this open council seat.  We see all of their faults....and holy cow, do they have faults.  Not to be judgmental here, but I can honestly say that any dysfunction my own family has (don't we all?) pales in comparison to the families Rowling introduces us to.Small town politics, Rowling shows, can be just as dirty as the big leagues and often with more dire consequences.  The central political argument in our small town here is the presence of a low-rent neighborhood.  Our characters vying for the council seat are split between eschewing any social responsibility and those who believe there can be redemption of the downtrodden.While it might seem that Rowling is blatantly championing social responsibility, in reality she goes to great pains to present reality....there is no right answer.  While it is certainly a noble ideal, Rowling shows that ideals sometimes fall far, far short.Ultimately, I very much enjoyed her work here.  Yes, as I'm sure you've heard, there is a lot of vulgar language, a lot of sex, drug usage, etc and so on.  And I thought every last bit was pertinent to the story!

"0316228532","A22M7NYKAKPOSR","Monica Dobrin","Casual Vacancy","I'm not sure what I was expecting when I picked up this book but I did find that she relies too much on two very strong themes that she focused on heavily in the later Harry Potter books. It is possible to write a good, moving story that isn't focused on death and teen angst, however she leans very heavily on these devices. The messages about the world we see and the lives that are actually behind them are strong, which is why I'm plowing through to the end, but it drags. It almost feels like she is trying to beat us over the head with the grit of life and death.Edit: I have finished the book. For those who find it dull to begin with, it does get more exciting. Rowling does what she does best, building to a strange, unexpected climax. Without giving away too much of the ending, we find out the results of a selfish society that waves away the problems of the poor and focuses on their own foolish nonsense.My initial opinion of the book still stands. She relies too much on the 'shocker' tactics she used in the Harry Potter series. Death plays a huge role as a beginning and an end, side characters that you learn to sympathize with become monsters in their own rights, a hero is found from an unlikely source.Overall, I'm not sure I would read it again. At least, not the whole thing. It's dark, gritty, painful at times to read because of the torture inflicted on the characters.

She has encouraged children to read and stands up for the rights of those who have been abused throughout the world. She is an amazing person.I was thrilled to receive this book as a gift. I had been looking forward to its release for months and couldn't wait to see what she had dreamed up next. Early on in the story, I was having the hardest time relating to any of the characters and had a difficult time keeping all of them straight. I was already disappointed about the number of F bombs she had dropped but was hoping it was going to be restricted to one or two characters in the story. So I began doing what I never do...I skimmed the rest of the book. I was hoping to find something redeeming, but what I found instead was an incredibly crass and ugly world where no one really seems to genuinely care for anyone other than themselves.

I  know not everyone will feel the way I do about this book, and they are certainly entitled to their opinions, but I feel that J. K.

"0316228532","A280DHBHKU8M8B","Mrs. Marian ""megalibrarian""","The Casual Vacancy","J.K. Rowling's latest novel is a compelling story of the downfalls of class distinction, small-town pettiness, troubled marriages, angry and immoral teens, and the effects of abuse and poverty.  It is raw and painful; an insight into the struggles of people with no meaning in their lives beyond what is here and now.  J.K. Rowling is an amazing author, but I was so disappointed that her first 'adult' novel was so full of gratuitous smut.  Harry Potter went through life at Hogwarts never once having to relieve himself or take a bath, but in this novel we get descriptions of every sort of nastiness out there.  The main characters were supposed to be the adults, but Rowling's teens are the driving force in this novel, as well as the source of most of the vulgarity and disgusting behavior.  Why is it that today's authors seem to feel the need to add vulgarity and smut to their work in order to be read?  The Casual Vacancy covers nearly all of humanity's ills in lurid detail.  I can fully understand drug abuse, pornography, teen sexuality, child abuse, infidelity, and pedophilia without being dragged into the back bedroom to witness it.

"0316228532","A3ORX4G4Y772L8","M. Stark","A bleak view of humanity","I had to stop reading at around page 130. To say that this book is dysfunctional would be an understatement. It portrays humans in the worst light possible, and I saw absolutely no redeeming qualities in the characters (and there are many-- which is another thing, I couldn't even keep everyone straight!) I see this book as JK Rowling's experimentation with extremely upsetting subjects and multiple point of views. But I have to say, I don't think this experiment is a successful one and I hope she never writes something so depressing again.Now to get into some things that absolutely didn't work and why I gave up on The Casual Vacancy. I love dialogue in books. In fact, I am more of a dialogue person than a long narration person because I feel like stories should be about people, not endless descriptions.  But the dialogue was just awful. Let me explain why. Firstly, she uses grammatically incorrect speech in order to show the social statuses of the characters. I know a lot of writers use this stylistic choice, but I've never liked it because not only is it distracting, but it can also be difficult to figure out what the character is trying to say. I don't want to have to stop reading so I can puzzle over sentences. Secondly, the swearing. I am not easily offended by swearing, but when some of the characters use the f-bomb about twenty times in two pages, that is just unnecessary. The dialogue reads like a TV show, and had this been a screenplay, I wouldn't have minded the style she used. However, this is the written word and those choices don't work as well in book format.Now to get to the characters. As I mentioned before, I could not remember all of them. JK Rowling uses new chapters for each character POV, but when so many of them are being thrown at you and the chapters themselves are short, it's hard for one of them to make an impression on you. I usually like flawed characters, but almost every single one of these particular characters disgusted me in some way and I could not relate to any of them. I don't want to read about horny teenage boys. I don't want to read about drug addicts who can't take care of themselves or their children. I don't want to read about the petty cruelty of people living in a small community. I will go as far to say that the characters in this book represent everything I hate about humanity. Reading about people like this just negatively reinforces my own beliefs that human beings are horribly messed up. It makes me angry and then I dwell on things I would rather not dwell on. After reading some other reviews on here that included spoilers, I'm glad that I've stopped reading when I have as the subject matter gets even worse.This was just a bad fit for me because I don't read this genre in general. I don't like gritty stories, but I wanted to give it a chance because it was from JK Rowling. And for fans of Harry Potter, this couldn't be more different. It's actually shocking to me that the same author wrote this, but I think that's the reaction she was going for. If JK Rowling wanted to show everyone that she could write something steeped in realism while being brutally honest about the deviancy of her characters, then she succeeded. She recently said in an interview she will continue to write as long as she has something to say. And there's definitely a message here about people living in small towns and about the state of humanity in general, but I want some hope in the things I read, even if it's just a little bit. After waiting five years to read her new work, this was a huge let down for me. I'll be returning my book.",2,"09 28, 2012",1348790400,"[99, 129]"

He was a good man of humble beginnings, genuinely loved and missed. With him gone, First Citizen (Mayor) Howard Mollinson, puffed up and elderly,has won! No one else has the power to defeat him on zoning and tax issues. Rowling invents 22 true-to-life, aptly named townspeople, injects humour and entices the reader into an increasingly less lighthearted labyrinth of follies, foul-ups and interrelationships. Teen-agers can't stand their parents and grownups fail to understand their kids.No one heads in a good direction and finally tragedy strikes with few pages left to go.

One must,  like  with Pinocchio,  readily acknowledge that they are ""real boys"" and girls, actual people. Teenagers against their parents, parents against  progeny, teenagers in love, fragile, desperate adults trying to act like adults, but not quite succeeding: there isn't one protagonist that can hide  its deepest,  inner thoughts from the reader or escape judgment from its stern eye.Furthermore, J.K Rowling's manner of proceeding is very realistic: the amount of sugarcoating is close to nil. No saint, no hero, no victor, no messiah. Just a society at war where secret  truths are revealed sometimes humorously, sometimes in a cringe-worthy manner.What did make me frown, I must say were the weaknesses the female characters dealt with. All the female protagonists, whether strong or feeble, held a certain amount of sickening dependence to a man. It was not so with the male protagonists whose weaknesses resided in themselves for the most part.Aside from this drawback, which for me is an important one, I believe  Mrs. Rowling has created a masterpiece  which every author should emulate.4,5 stars",5,"10 13, 2013",1381622400,"[0, 0]"

I am sorry, but this will be a very dull uninspiring review. I cannot help it, that is how the book left me.When I first picked up this book, I did not understand what all the fuss way about. How could so many people dislike a book just because the author branched out and wrote something different? From time to time, authors need to explore other storylines. I have no problem with that - loved when Grisham writes books other than legal thrillers. However, for some to find the need to compare everything to Potter was just ludicrous.The first hundred pages were mostly character development; I must confess that I had to do an internet search to keep them all straight. Still not understanding the dislike by many, since I like British mysteries and found this book to start out the same way, I trudged on.Then I got to page 200'ish. Dang this story is not moving. OK, maybe it is me. Then page 300 and 400. Darn it. I had such high hopes for this book. It was not until page 400'ish of 500'ish that I actually enjoyed what was being told. Sorry, but that is too late for anyone.Even after finishing the book, I will not say that is was horrible, just wanted more mystery or suspense I guess. Nowhere was this book billed as a mystery, but for some reason that is what I had in my mind. As I said before - it was me developing a preconceived notion as to what this book was about.Billed as a tragicomedy, the novel is set in a suburban town called Pagford and begins with the unexpected death of Barry Fairbrother. With Barry's death, there is an open seat on the council up for grabs. What ensues is an all-out war amongst the people of Pagford even before an election can be held for his successor.For such a small town, this place is full of secrets and when they suddenly come to the surface in blog postings, no one is safe.

Rowling is legit.","Obviously, after seven Harry Potter books, JK Rowling was basically all set as far as her checkbook was concerned...but while I certainly enjoyed those books even as an adult, there's always the question of ""is this all there is?"" As though those stories weren't enough, since they were ""fantasy.""Years ago, Stephen King answered his own critics with ""Different Seasons,"" a collection of novellas that included ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" It was his first foray into ""literary"" fiction, just like ""Vacancy"" is for Rowling.Like King, Rowling also pulled it off. This is an excellent example of legitimate storytelling, and it is absolutely impressive how well she juggles a huge cast, dozens of plots and subplots, and pulls it all together for a heartbreak of a conclusion. Yes, there's a bit of melodrama at the end, but for at least 90 percent of the conclusion, it's played straight, even when events are spiraling out of control for many members of the cast.Characters shift from sympathetic to villains and back and forth. I did have issues following who was who in the early going, but by the book's back half it all made sense. I'm most impressed with how tight the book feels - even though its 500+ pages. Stephen King's more recent books, for example, feel very under-edited, but that's not the case here. There were no examples of digressions or tangents that didn't factor into the larger story in some important way.There's sex and swearing, but it reads honestly and is hardly anything special. This is an adult-themed novel to be sure, but I think that Potter fans who are graduating to more mature books would find this a good step forward (a comment below mentions a self-mutilation plot-line, and that's certainly a sub-topic some readers will not be interested in, which I understand. But it is real life, and various parent-child relations are presented harshly and realistically).It gets a little Desperate Housewives-y at times. The suburban gossip and feuds seem so petty on the page, but then of course they do - that's the point. Once past the first 100 pages or so, the various plots begin to seem less derivative. Ultimately, this is an advanced look at death and what gets left behind.A few characters are surprisingly redeemed, while others fall to the pressure. She puts enough red herrings out there to where I was never quite sure, and to my surprise, I didn't see the ending coming until it was obvious.It's very well done, and it's an exciting, careful study of both characters and a town. I almost want to see a sequel, but I think this story's told...but I certainly want to see Rowling's next effort.

Still, I doubt many have reached the same conclusions as I have.  I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that many should look askance at a book so different from Harry Potter books--it reminds me of some American Idol contestants who take a big risk, trying on a style extremely different from their usual one--as Angie did this week.  There are some downsides to this book--esp. the very large cast of characters--but thenWar and Peace (Vintage Classics)has even more. Interestingly, no two have the same first name.  I actually made an MS Word crib sheet to keep them straight.Overall, this book is extraordinarily well-written and the characters are sharply drawn and multidimensional.  It almost reads like a mystery novel.  The psychological aspects are astounding--you are shown first one side, then other sides of individual characters throughout the book.  This may bother you.  I found it quite intriguing, however.  In addition, it's rather dark--possibly quite disappointing to one expecting a Potter-like work.  I suspect it might shake up a dedicated Rowling fan--breaking through the reader's Halo Effect and common leniency errors.  This could easily produce an extreme reaction--per the Pendulum Principle (Knowledge management and information technology: Know-IT encyclopedia).Basically, it's reminiscent of the movieIt's A Wonderful Lifewith the variation that the character (Barry Fairbrothers) dies and then one is shown the multiple effects (mostly disastrous) of his death on the people who knew him directly and indirectly.  The ploy used is the Parish Council seat left vacant by his death (thus the title of the book).  This book is not for the weak of heart.  If tragedy turns you off, you might want to consider avoiding this book.  But, if you want to understand the experiences of a highly varied group of people--both up and down, though it includes the seamier parts of town as well as the seamier aspects of people from the ""right side of the tracks,"" you might be very impressed.  Be prepared for tragedy--I'll avoid spoilers here.  I have to admit, however, that the ending is a bit heart-wrenching.  Still, overall IMHO it's a dark masterpiece--displaying the shadow side of humanity--esp. people's narcissism and self-centered orientations.  It doesn't raise your faith in humanity--it's too starkly realistic (in many ways) for that.  I think that to appreciate the book, one needs to be prepared to accept the realities of the human condition--especially how (as described by Alice Miller inPrisoners Of Childhood: The Drama of the Gifted Child and the Search for the True Self) traits are passed on between generations.  Yet, deeply considered, it also shows how individuals can break out of their heritages and grow--even if it takes a Significant Emotional Experience to do so.",5,"03 29, 2013",1364515200,"[1, 1]"

"0316228532","ALEQWN4YTM5UU","Nerine Dorman","A cautionary tale","I purposefully avoided most of the reviews written about JK Rowling's new novel, The Casual Vacancy, while I was reading the book myself. I wanted to experience the novel without any of the preconceptions of others. To a degree I was successful, and in retrospect I'm glad I made the effort.The author warned readers right from the start that this wasn't another Harry Potter. Unlike a large number of angry and disappointed readers I was vaguely aware of on my periphery, I took Rowling's advice to heart. As much as that wiggly little childlike voice inside me whined and moaned for more Hogwarts, I fed it some codeine tablets and a chocolate bar and laid it down to rest while the adult in me settled in a cosy armchair over a cup of coffee to read The Casual Vacancy.This is not a very nice book. Which is precisely why I absolutely adored it. That being said, I'm also quite happy to admit that if Rowling had not been the author, chances are very good I would not have picked it up. I am unashamedly a fan of JK Rowling's, the same as I am a fan of Neil Gaiman, Storm Constantine, Anne Rice or Poppy Z Brite, and will give everything they write a fair chance even if they're writing outside of their expected genres.But more about why I don't like nice books - they don't come across as being authentic. Real life doesn't have neat, convenient happy endings and, as much as it can be argued that reading is often a lot about pure escapism, I like knowing that there's always a chance that the character I'm rooting for will fail. So, it's down to personal preference.If you're looking for a rose-tinted happy ending, then DON'T read The Casual Vacancy. If you're looking for a story where the underdog is likeable, DON'T read this book. In fact, there are absolutely no likeable characters at all in this story. Yes, there are some I grudgingly kinda like, but no one for whom I'd willingly don a cheerleading outfit. I'm pretty sure that if Barry Fairbrother didn't die in the start of the book, some of his dirty secrets would have come tumbling out before long too.He's the real hero of this novel, and he bows out early, so we never get an accurate idea of what his true character is like. We end up viewing Barry through everyone else's somewhat rose-tinted glasses, and he is placed on a pedestal, as the only resident of Pagford who was able to dream up a bigger vision which expanded beyond the narrow-minded pettiness of the others. What Rowling says, at the end, is that the world needs more people like Barry Fairbrother, and thoughI don't want to spoil, I'll suggest that in the end we do encounter someone who will step into the breach and fill his shoes. And it's not anyone you'd suspect, so shhh.I'll say this much, that I was pleasantly surprised to see this character grow beyond the societal pressures.As always, what I absolutely adore about Rowling's writing is her characterisation. Her prose might not be scintillating, but, much like Neil Gaiman, George RR Martin and Stephen King, she understands the rare art of storytelling, and of offering readers characters with whom they can identify - who hold up a sometimes dark mirror to our own reflections.We all know people like Howard, Samantha, Krystal, Kay, Gavin and Simon; people who are more often than not blind to their own faults. They lie to themselves as often as they lie to others, and act short-sightedly. They're human, like us, broken and sometimes bitter.If anything The Casual Vacancy is a cautionary tale, warning us to be more aware of our interconnectedness, and the web that glues society together. Despite the tragedy of the human condition, the novel also dares us to hope, and if there is ever to be any change in the world, it must first start with oneself.",5,"11 7, 2012",1352246400,"[3, 3]"
"0316228532","A2LLS8LVOHTP0I","Nic","Not What I Expected","About the Book:In the small town of Pagford, England, Barry Fairbrother drops dead, leaving a seat open in the local council. His death affects the people of Pagford, both directly and indirectly, causing a flourish of gossip and glimpses of what humanity tends to be.Review:When this book originally came out, I had little to no intention of reading it. Even though it was written by J.K. Rowling, I felt like it would have been of little interest to me, but then my friend suggested it to me so I decided to give it a go. I must say that I am entirely glad that I did. To sum it up in one word: wow!Now, I will say that there isn't a lot of plot in this book; it most certainly is a book that focuses on the characters -- nay, people. To say they are simply characters would discredit Rowling's talent. Her creations have so many complexities and layers that the word character doesn't quite hit the mark. Rowling did such a wonderful job of portraying the faults of humanity that I had to stop reading several times due to emotional overload. That's not to say that all the characters are horrible people. Many mean well but end up making bad decisions, and many make decisions based on their wants and needs more than anything else. Now, the drama may be above average (we have physical abuse, drug addicted parents, and suicidal thoughts, for example), but unlike a soap opera, you can find yourself believing all of these situations. It certainly helps that Rowling takes up through the characters' thoughts. Now, one thing that may bother some readers is the constant shifting point of view. Personally, this didn't bother me, and I cannot see the book working as well as it did if she had written it any other way. However, this can be a major turnoff for some readers so I thought it wise to mention it. Honestly, the only problem I had with the work was that it had a slow start. A lot of this had to do with introducing a large cast of characters, but it was certainly a struggle to get through the first hundred pages or so. Still, it was worth it.Before I wrap up this review, I would like to talk about a couple more things that kept surrounding this novel, mostly the language and sex, although the latter isn't in minute detail. Dear god, I have heard so many complaints involving the adult content that I felt the need for a rebuttal of some sort. A lot of people seem to be under the impression that J.K. Rowling upped all the mature content to remove her from Harry Potter. A lot of people have been saying that she is using too much language, too much sex. Bollocks! Now, I am in no way saying that there isn't a lot of foul language and sexual content. Hardly but these people don't seem to realise how much people cuss. Besides it's not like J.K. Rowling is having every single character cuss like a sailor. Guess what? Sex also happens to be a large part of humanity as a whole. Again, not every one of us is driven by our genitals, but at large, humans are very sexual creatures. Yes, we tend to hide it away, but remember that this is a book that is supposed to get inside the characters and show us their secrets. Needless to say, you are bound to get uncivilised acts and language when you are reading a book of this nature. This certainly isn't a book for everyone. However, for those who don't mind some uncouth language and some very real type problems, for those who enjoy character driven books and stories that dig into the crevices of the characters' minds, I could not recommend this book more.",5,"04 5, 2013",1365120000,"[1, 2]"

But for Harry Potter fans, I warn you, this is not at all a fantasy and is not the feel good novel that her Harry Potter series often was. Instead this book is a work of literary fiction that exposes the petty behavior and apathy of a small town, full of fairly affluent middle class people, towards a community of impoverished people on their border. Rowling has created a story that most people could see unfolding everyday outside their own doors, if only they would stop and really look. Her characters are totally believable, but not necessarily likable (though there are a few that I liked).

You could go into almost any town in the world and come away with these raw human emotions.  I liked how she reminded all of us that people are not always what them seem.  People turn out the way they are due to their youth circumstances and whether or not they are surrounded by loved ones or people who really care what happens to them in this world. It's also about how small minded people can be when their egos get in the way. I definitely suggest reading this novel.

The first book was fun, but halfway through the second I realized they were all going to be the same, so I stopped reading. When I found &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; in a bookstore remainder bin I picked it up in the hope this would be different, having no allegiance to the last seven books that brought J.K. Rowling fame and fortune.I never would have imagined that she would pick a black comedy for her adult debut. Or that I would enjoy it so much.&#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; is about life in a small village somewhere in the west of England. There's nothing magical about Pagford, hidden over the hill and a short bus ride from the nearest town. Pretty? Definitely. Bucolic? Nah. Sleepy? No way! This little berg is a hive of activity: politics, pride, resentment, betrayal; all you need to fill 500 pages. As we learn from the inside cover...what lies behind the pretty facade is a town at war.It's easy to see that this book is going to disappoint a lot of people. No plot...there goes the Kindle contingent; no magic..there goes the YA fan club; no Quidditch...there go the sports fans; swear words...there goes the geriatric group; no happy ending...there goes 90% of the rest of the reading public. If you haven't deleted yourself in the aforementioned list...you might actually enjoy the book.This is a classic dark comedy and it's actually quite good. J.K. Rowling's forte is in putting the reader inside the head of about 16 different major characters and just as many minor ones, creating a complete world in a snow globe. She has an uncanny gift for showing why people can live together for years and yet never really understand each other, because they're all so busy wrapped up in themselves. I'm surprised at the criticism that there is no transformation, no change for the good at the end of the book. I can't believe they missed it, right there at the end, Part Seven. It's so obvious it's almost biblical...to say more would be a spoiler!Some reviewers have been frustrated by all the different points of view. Here is where it might actually be easier to read in the print version, looking back for names you've forgotten is hard enough to do on Kindle and almost impossible in the audio book. Yet it's sometimes necessary for the first hundred pages or so, until all the characters sort themselves out in your mind.

Hard subject,very much like XIX. Naturalism in French literature after 1860, admired Zola, it is likely that you may admire Casual Vacancy also.Sadness... But don't many people live like this? As abusers, bigots, or victims,as activists whose efforts meet without misunderstanding, or even hostility because other are hostile to people who the activists help? Or some people live in cold indifference without much thinking or feeling about ethics, because they have not the problems the others experience? Or do others who are terribly deprived labor in heroic ways and are met with disdain while they are heroes in their own way?(""Bad girl"" Cristal in this novel for example). J.K. Rowling takes sides, but sides often need to be taken, and she explains why, and does it indirectly, without preaching, through showing, not saying.Brilant work with great attention to detail and fine story telling.Some complained that R.K. Rowling heavily criticized the middle class. I think everyone gets criticized.There are the upper crust members, people who live in the Sweetloves mansion.Those are not very present in the novel, but they are not angels. Middle class is criticized,as probably more visible in every day society in which we live, but the poor are getting their bitter critique, in their case they are more excused. For example heroin addiction is no ta choice,after all, is a very strong compulsion which is a battle, authors shows it. Or self harm, she explains the psychology behind both cases very well. And in cases of other problems. For sure j.K. Rowling did her homework, I admire that, she didn't shy away form difficult matters.This book is not an escapist one, and in addition to its own literary qualities this is has value on its own. Some art, writing serve as conscience of societies, this work is one of them.WE need such works,as we need investigative journalism, but it takes courage to deal with such subjects. This book shows a society which is morally in state or morally bankrupt.Which doesn't mean that all people are devoid of ethical instinct,or total war mongering sadists of some kind, no.There are of course kind of sadisits and victims among them: too ignorant to be nice,or have real sadistic streak,  have trouble with temper and no insight whatever.Or victim admiring the tormenter of all family, the battered wife who doesn't help her children but admires he husband and always excuses him.And quite a number of examples of dysfunctional interaction between people.So, it is not a pleasant read, rather one which can make someone cry.The book has two buildings which I find symbolic: ruined abbey on the hill and mansion which belonged to the gentry, the Sweetloves.No monks no Sweetloves are there anymore. The monastery had inhabitants who were daily devoted to high standard of morality,as much as we may criticize them, and see them as foreign, they did their share of effort and often were good example. Gentry, with all privilege and bigotry relating to class did effort to make their ways of life more gracious, filled with respect to others, even if this respect was directed to their own class only. In any case members of those types of communities respected their own member if they were ethically advanced. Not so for the community of Pagford.Yes, Barry Fairbrother does his great job, and only some can understand him, other engage in their petty local politics and hostilities fueled by ignorance and bigotry.The empty ruin of Christian monastery overlooks the community which claims to upheld high moral standards, but is not. Sweetloves' mansion is on the same level as the rest of community, just set apart,and other empty or inhabited by empty people to whom privilege in not obliging to anything, no noblesse oblige, they don't have any sense of obligation but they feel above all and enjoy their elevated position as a reason to feel above others and feel disdain. The hope for the  community lies in those who are able to break from it constrictions, have mental courage to face those who are empty.",5,"02 22, 2013",1361491200,"[0, 0]"

I didn't dread listening to it or consider stopping, but the story just wasn't very good.  It was very much like a soap opera.

No one is all one type, but in Pagford, everyone is either miserable or making someone miserable.  As far as I can tell the only good person in the town is the protagonist who dies in the first couple of pages creating the Casual Vacancy which is the title of the book. Other than that, not a whole lot actually happens.  It's all about character development.  So you do get quite intimate with the characters.  As it turns out I'm not real interested in getting intimate with so many broken people.--------------------------------End Spoilers-----------------------As usual, Rowling's fascination with young adults is forefront, but I have to admit she writes them really well.

"0316228532","A18B0NHSDNVD6R","Pandorasecho ""Dixie""","Lumos","Of course all the reactions that are in all the other reviews of this book happened for me.  I was delighted that JK Rowling Was going to be publishing another book.  I was sad and unbelieving and hopeful and worried when I heard that it would not be part of the Harry Potter universe.  I am after all a functioning, adult woman, who just happens to also be a major Potterhead.I actually didn't start out loving Harry Potter.  That seems unreal to me now, but I remember thinking that the characters were stereotyped and the story itself was unoriginal and merely a rewriting of old stories.  Then I fell in love and never looked back.  So I trusted Rowling, and when I started the new book, I was willing to keep going even though I did not really like the Casual Vacancy.  I still didn't like it by 100 pages in and I was having a hard time keeping the characters straight.  The book has no clear central character and the view point changes from one section to another and back again so you never get to know enough about one group of people in the first introduction to have them firmly in your mind the next time they appear.  It was a confusing feeling like the first week in a new town when you always wonder, ""have I met this person before, should I recognize some details or is this all new?""I spoke to other people who were reading the book and found that we shared some of the same feelings and had some interest in the same characters, but agreed that they were not exactly people you would ""like"" or want to know in real life.  But ""Real Life"" is what this book is all about.  I found myself recognizing situations and people in a way that was a bit uncomfortable and gritty.  I flinched at some of the brutal detail and the language, but after 23 years teaching children and meeting their families, especially those in Severely Handicapped classes, none of the brutality sounded unreal or exaggerated.  JK Rowling's new book is not a magical escape but rather a confrontation with the part of town a lot of people prefer to avoid.By the time I finished the final chapter, and turned the back cover, and glanced once more at the author blurb, the final line of the back flap stood up and slapped me awake.  ""She supports a wide range of causes and is the founder of Lumos, which works to transform the lives of disadvantaged children.""Then I saw it, and I realized this book is very similar to Harry Potter after all.There is even a faint reference to Harry Potter in one line on page 81, "" . . . once, (she dreamed of it, still), a child who had been locked in a cupboard for five days by his psychotic stepfather.""So this book is, like Harry Potter, about fear and prejudice against those who are different, and about children who are unwanted, or even if wanted, neglected through ignorance and desperation.  There is much about Harry and Krystal Weedon that is similar, but then with Harry there was an owl, and a magic school and a quiddich team and friends with powers and hope.  There were teachers who saw potential and nurtured it.  For Krystal there is no magic owl, and the rowing team breaks up when the book begins with the one adult who saw her potential, dropping dead. Her peer friends were also 16 year old powerless foster kids. Life without the magic, but still trying to show that disadvantaged children are really there, and we all need to stop looking away.  Let there be light.  Lumos.",5,"10 8, 2012",1349654400,"[4, 6]"

In my opinion, this novel is an unhappy, vulgar novel made up of trite characters using trite elements of conflict.There are so many characters that it is hard to keep track of them without keeping a chart.  The characters were very umsympathetic - the author seemed to emphasize the worst personaliity traits of pretty predictable characters.  Yes, there is irony at the end - the least liked character turns out to be a hero at her death.There are quite a few unanswered questions at the end, but unfortunately, I didn't even care if they were answered or not.At times, the author uses some effective literary elements (metaphors and similes) and some visualizations.

Rowling's first adult  novel, The Casual Vacancy.If I rated books out of 5 stars, I'd give this one 3 stars. The first 100 pages were deadly dull and confusing with all the unrelated characters. As the characters came together, the plot moved along more quickly.People who've read the Harry Potter series might think Rowling didn't veer that far from her original series with this book. Some of the main characters are two teenage boys (one of whom is an orphan who was adopted) and two teenage girls. They're all unhappy with their lives and find ways to get back at their parents.But the main focus of the book was truly income and education inequality. One of the characters is a crass, poor teenage girl with a drug-addicted mom. The girl is made more lovable with her devotion to her toddler brother.The middle and upper class characters have these fake worries in their life, like who will win the open seat on the town council, while the poor characters struggle to survive. The teenagers are self-absorbed and cruel.Rowling's book did not become preachy, but perhaps it was her effort to avoid preachiness that caused it to be devoid of emotions. A good book should make the reader feel many things. This one didn't, even as tragedies unfolded at the end.Although the book didn't evoke emotions, it did make me think more about what the middle and upper classes owe the struggling lower class. Rowling lived a life on the British equivalent of welfare, so she understands the differences between surviving and thriving. Here, she makes a point of showing us that the poor live a very different lifestyle, one that most middle-class people judge and can't begin to imagine.If I saw a kid drowning, I would definitely save him.

It is a page turner, it has characters to love and hate and it takes us on a journey to conclusion.That is not to say that I seek to visit these characters again. By-and -large they are better left alone after introduction. In Australian vernacular they are a cast of nuff-nuffs and wanna-be's and bring out the worst aspects of the class divide that still obviously rules Britannia or parts of it.Its premise of consequences from actions is brilliantly exploited. Someone dies, cages are rattled and all the simmering discontent within a community unravels explosively.Gritty, confronting and reflecting the need for societal change are all covered and Jo confronts these challenges realistically.

Rowling to write imaginative stories filled with unique characters set in a fascinating environment. None of these expectations were met in ""The Casual Vacancy."" Forget that this is not a Harry Potter book. John Updike wrote about reality (or the effects of intrusions on reality) for decades. Yet, even in his most suburban novels, the characters were unique, the environment was suffused with a kind of underlying tension, and the stories were emotional adventures. This is never the case with this new book. The most touching character is Krystal, the welfare-class teenager who contends with a stupefied mother, a filthy environment, and a little brother who is infected from negligence. The other characters, (including the off-page Barry Fairweather who [spoiler] dies in the introduction) are mostly noticeable for their being annoying and narcissistic. The entire plot revolves around Fairweather's apparent charisma which is spoken about but never illustrated. We have to take the word of characters who routinely lie and misrepresent for purposes so petty and insignificant that we wonder what in God's name convinced the great Ms. Rowling that this was an interesting tale to tell.Yes, there is a great attention to detail. Often too much. When James Joyce wrote the thoughts of ordinary people, they were thoughts that all of us could relate to. When Ms. Rowling does it, in excruciating detail, it is almost vacuous. I found myself skipping whole screens of ""inner thought"" on my kindle. Sometimes, I skimmed over so much material that I felt that I was speed reading. However I have to give Ms. Rowling credit for one thing: she does know her characters. Each character is consistent and completely (perhaps too completely) drawn.

Whether it is the burden of these expectations, or whether the author is simply comfortable writing only for a certain audience, the book is unmistakably written for the legion of Potter fans.`Casual Vacancy' is not so much of a novel for adults as a storybook for the adolescents. The author, ever mindful of her target audience and their desire for simplicity, keeps the story about as simple as it can be: good vs. bad. This black and white characterization extends even to the locations: for example the village of Pagford is charming and picturesque; but the Fields that adjoins the village is a dangerous place with drugs and dope peddled openly! Consistent with the theme of keeping it simple, the characters are two-dimensional and true to stereotype.As for the characters, one cannot but fail to notice that they represent the different demographics. It is no sin for authors to be market oriented, but one hopes it is not so obvious.Still, once the book gets under way the story keeps humming along ... after a fashion.

You cannot compare this book to the Harry Potter series or expect Rowling to handle both stories the same way.  I think J.K. Rowling does a great job at weaving together a story with many different characters and subplots.  One thing Rowling does better than many authors is really make you feel like you're just as involved in the story as the characters are.  It started off a bit slow but that's not completely atypical of novels, and there are a lot of characters which takes some getting used to.  But once you do, the story picks up and really takes off.

The humour I remember fondly from 'Harry...' is also absent; satire reigns in this novel when tragedy doesn't.The story is all about the emotions of the characters and the mistakes they make, and there really isn't anyone you can like 100% because of this; as J.K Rowling said in a recent interview, the hero of the story died in the very first pages.Despite the fact I found 'The Casual Vacancy' a bit slow-paced due to it's focus on emotional and social factors, I barely put it down for the few days it took me to read and it was constantly on my mind when I wasn't reading it.

My tears fell for the characters in the book, and their injustices, their pain, and the knowledge that real-life people are going through the same, and worse.This isn't the first time J.K. Rowling has made me cry. Her themes of respect, friendship, and death are as apparent in The Casual Vacancy as they were in Harry Potter. The Casual Vacancy opens with the death of Barry Fairbrother, a member of the town council in Pagford. Just like with Harry's mother, Lily Evans, we learn about Barry mostly through the way people speak of him. He is kind, perhaps to a fault. He is generous. He is smart, works hard, and cares for people less fortunate than him. People like Krystal Weedon, a high school student from the poor side of town who Barry takes under his wing.The tale that follows Barry's death is full of gossip in a small town, and how it affects the city council election for Barry's now open spot. There's gossip, bullying, drinking, drugs, affairs, and sex. But also HOW that gossip, bullying, drinking, drugs, affairs, and sex affect the people involved. Through Rowling's beautifully crafted characters, you learn about the bully and bullied. You see both sides, and Rowling poses no judgement. She leaves that to you.My favorite thing about this book, and the Harry Potter series, is how Rowling illustrates respect. Harry respects living creatures, no matter how small or insignificant. He sees what's in their hearts and not the purity of their blood. In The Casual Vacancy, almost everyone does bad things. But who is a bad person? Is it a drug addict prostitute mother? Is it a man who cheats on his wife? Is it a teenager with every privilege who harasses people for sport?

While the book is a total departure from her previous writing, it is truly a strong attempt to enter the world of real people and go beyond the obvious. Though set in a small village somewhere in England, the situations and personalities could be anywhere. The ulterior motives and the quick  and partial judgement people put on each other is a universal case. The story is so revealing in its analysis of human personalities that it leaves you with a sense of wanting to understand in your own life what drives you and everyone around you  and what is it that they are thinking beyond the obvious. You start to think about their fears and aspirations as well as the hidden feelings and actions.

Rowling since I first picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone but I've never enjoyed anything she's written as much as The Casual Vacancy.  It appears that being freed from the fetters of her imagined magical world has allowed her to show us a view of the real world, the one in which we all live, that is more vibrant and alive than anything Harry, Ron and Hermione could experience.At its core, The Casual Vacancy hearkens back to a much older type of English novel, something like Middlemarch, with its explorations of race, gender and especially class and its setting in a common-or-garden variety English village.  Rowling deftly draws us into her characters lives and shows us what makes them tick.  The characters are all familiar, not because they remind us of characters from Harry Potter (they don't) but because they remind us of people we know and are.The pain and joy of growing up has always been something Rowling has written about well and in The Casual Vacancy she is able to explore adolescence without having to sugar-coat the experience with the promise of magic in the background.  For a teenager, fighting against Ultimate Evil Incarnate is not nearly as terrible as the quotidian horrors of boredom and embarrassment.  The young people in The Casual Vacancy are not all nice kids but Rowling is able to pop us into their minds to see what motivates them as individuals.Her portraits of the middle-aged are no less compelling.  The teenagers in The Casual Vacancy tend to see escape from Pagford as the ticket to a ""real"" life.  For many of the adults, either this kind of flight is impossible or they are old enough to realize that it is futile to think in these terms.  Their lives are in the carapaces they have constructed for themselves.There is disturbing material in this book.  Speech and action are at times vulgar and violent.  Sex is messy.  Bad things happen to characters we care about.  But nothing feels gratuitous or out of place.  People in The Casual Vacancy act the way they do because of who they are, and that is what makes it a great novel.",5,"11 25, 2012",1353801600,"[7, 8]"

Not as engaging as Harry Potter by any means, but engaging enough to keep me reading even when I kept wanting to stop.However, I was quite disturbed by the frequent use of profanity in this book - including an overuse of the f-word - as well as the overly graphic descriptions of sex (or similarly graphic references to sex). I realize this book is supposed to be ""adult"" whereas Harry Potter was marketed to children, but I seriously was disturbed by this content, and kept telling myself I should stop reading, that this stuff was not what a decent Christian girl should be reading, but I think somehow I thought the book might get better eventually (which it does...the very end is a lot less adult than the rest of the book).That being said, Rowling does tackle a lot of societal issues in this book, some of which make sense given her personal background. For instance, she spends a lot of time on the issue of the Fields and the poverty there - and she herself was on welfare for many years. She deals with mental illness also, which we know she experienced (she said she based the Dementors off of her experiences being clinically depressed). Other issues covered in this book include adoption, death itself, physical and emotional abuse, cutting, drugs, gossip, prejudice, and hypocrisy. Probably all stuff Rowling has wanted to write about but couldn't in Harry Potter.

Initially I scared myself into thinking it wouldn't live up to the standards of Harry Potter and I would come away feeling disappointed.Then I started the book and remembered what a brilliant WRITER Rowling is, not just storyteller. Yes, the world of Harry Potter is complex and amazing and magical, but this is a novel. Staggeringly human, flawlessly executed, and realistic in a way you don't often see in books by authors as well known as Rowling.You end up having some very strong emotion towards all of the many characters she introduces (and there are a LOT, but it makes it a more complicating and interesting read). Whether this is sympathy, hatred, adoration, or irritation is left completely up to you. Rowling narrations provides no bias for the characters, the reader is left to understand what kind of a person these characters are.I also LOVE how she utilized the different dialects. Let's face it, when reading anything that comes out of England I usually hear a posh Jane Austen voice in my head narrating, unless otherwise specified. Rowling made sure to differentiate between London voices, country voices, the lower class of the country voices. To an American reader, this gave me a MUCH stronger sense of the culture and how to relate each character to their community.Definitely don't finish this book on a day when you're feeling down though (like I did, and then cried for the last 50 pages and a subsequent hour after completion). The book is absolutely heartbreaking, in a way that makes you cry because you're sad and then cry again because of its truth, and then CONTINUE to cry because you feel so utterly human you want to go hug someone.Rowling is, and will always be, one of my top five favorite authors because not only can she create one of the most intricate fantasy worlds since Tolkien, but she can write a novel of astounding proportions that has the power to change the face of contemporary literature.",5,"11 30, 2012",1354233600,"[3, 5]"

Rowling leaves the supernatural out of her first book written for an adult audience. Unfortunately, all the magic is missing. ""The Casual Vacancy"" is hard to get into and its characters largely lack appeal, probably for the same reason: in addition to omitting sorcery, Rowling steers clear of the exceptional. While it is possible to make stories about common lives work, it is far easier to engage readers in tales and characters of distinction and consequence.

The citizens of this town from young to old were for the most part unlikable, petty and obnoxious to name a flaws. It is is a testament to the writer that despite this I continued to read this novel and see it through. The novel goes on and on cycling through the character chronicling the events in the town following the death of Barry Fairbrother and up to and after the election to fill his vacant council spot. The entire book I was expecting it to build to a big finish, which it did for the most part. This was full of social and political commentary told through the events in a seemingly normal small town.

"0316228532","AN3D3M8MJ07BQ","Red Rock Bookworm","WWIII HAS COME TO PAGFORD","THE CASUAL VACANCY will undoubtedly be compared to J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books but be advised that except for the underlying grimness in both books, VACANCY is a different from Potter as night from day and this novel is definitely not for children or teens.In CASUAL VACANCY readers are introduced to Barry Fairbrother, recently deceased member of the Pagford Parish Council, but a presence that continues to linger via the lives of his many enemies and friends.  In the parish of Pagford the residents are an angry lot, prone to petulant, anonymous criticism of others, each desperate to keep a deep, dark secret permanently hidden while fearful that the wheels have come off the train and something odious is about to happen...........and often it does.The book is timely in it's depiction of the ongoing chasm between the rich and the poor and of the political machinations undertaken by each side in their respective attempts to ensure or overthrow the status quo. Diversity and catastrophe is the order of the day for the children who live in The Fields on the outskirts of Pagford and their lives read like something out of Oliver Twist.Rowling has crammed a lot of layers and complexity into this book with humor, pathos, morality tales and allegories running rampant on every page and many readers, if they look closely, will see themselves or their attitudes depicted in those pages.  I still haven't decided whether this book is thought provoking and uplifting or the biggest ""downer"" of the year.",3,"12 21, 2012",1356048000,"[2, 2]"

Even giving it a one is difficult.  Usually a book like this goes on my never to read ever shelf.  Unfortunately I listened to other readers that said if you finish the book, it comes together.No, it does not come together.  The dialogue is weak for all the characters.  That was also a problem; there are far too many characters.  The story would have been better if only one or two families would be the focus.  As a reader, I was never drawn into the story.  I never found a plot or a character I could grab onto and hold.If Rowling wanted to show dysfunctional families, a novel should not have been used.  She should have written a paper and submitted it to `Psychology Today'.There is no doubt we are a sick society, a selfish society, and a cruel society, but I can watch the news to see this.I don't know about other readers, but I like to go into a story and become one with it, it doesn't matter if it is light or dark.  I enjoy a strong plot, good dialogue, and strong characters.  This novel had none of the above.  It seemed to be a chopped up collection of characters with poor dialogue and poor story.  It seems ridiculous that it took so long to write.  It also seems to me that it was written here and there at different times.Some could say I didn't understand the symbolism.

"0316228532","AFGQLBLB5ZNWI","Regina ""Regina""","Beautifully Written Work of Art.","Casual Vacancy is a beautifully written work of art. Nothing has been missed in the story. No storyline was neglected. Every character and every scene is perfectly orchestrated to completion. Reading Casual Vacancy is like eating that perfect meal. It starts off with an explosion of flavor, akin to a beautifully prepared appetizer and from there Rowling guides the reader through a perfectly told story that is nicely sustained. A good story is one that the reader does not want to put down, but is not forced to rush through. It is a story that once over, its characters will be missed. And once completed, the storyline line and messages are still being contemplated in the minds of its readers. This is the brilliance of Casual Vacancy.What about the bad reviews? What about all the readers who put it down out of what they said was disappointment and boredom? I was not dissuaded or discouraged when I read the very first publicized negative reactions to Casual Vacancy or heard from various friends and other reviewers, ""My friend started this and was bored so she put it down"". Harry Potter had such huge wide spread appeal that it makes sense that many of her former fans would give this a try or think about giving it a try, but Casual Vacancy - while nearly perfectly written in my opinion - is not a book that will have wide spread appeal. Despite my opinion on this, Casual Vacancy does have staying power and it has its own beauty. The thing about Harry Potter is that all sorts of readers consumed it. And all sorts of non-readers read it. To please that type of audience would take something like, well the Hunger Games to satisfy everyone. But that is not being fair to Harry Potter and its fans, Hunger Games (in my opinion) while fun and very good, does not come close to the brilliance of the Harry Potter series (and if you have only read the first one or two in the series, then you have no idea what I mean ... read the later ones!). My point - Casual Vacancy is not a repeat of Harry Potter in terms of having wide spread appeal.At the risk of being confusing and contradictory - Casual Vacancy is very similar to Harry Potter. Whaatttt????For readers of the entire series of Harry Potter, I am confident what remains with them even years after reading the books are the characters - the depth of the individuals developed, their struggles with moral dilemmas, the depiction of how absolutely horrible human beings can be to others when given the opportunity, their personal losses and their small victories. That is what I remember, more than any complicated mythology behind wands and horcruxes - I remember the characters. The Harry Potter books are immense in length and the story takes 7 books to tell, because it is the characters' stories that filled the pages.Casual Vacancy appears to be set in a nearly perfect setting: a small town where people know each other and have for generations. This is a town that is not war torn, is not fighting a famine or dangerous gangs and is not facing a spiraling out of control crime rate. This book does not have an external pressure affecting its characters or a complicated plot line each is struggling through. What this story comes down to is just the people appearing on the pages of the book and how people live their lives, how people treat each other, and what motivates them to act. The story is told from the alternating third person point of view a large number of characters. At first, keeping track of each character is task. I actually kept a cheat sheet. However, after about 10% of the book each character was solidly embedded and I no longer needed my notes. In the beginning of the story, it first appears that all of the characters are somehow involved with one main character that has died. And yes, while that is true they have that in common, that is not really the point - the point is not their connection but their own individual stories.The characters in Casual Vacancy are each trapped in their own universe of interests, surrounded by their own self focused motives. They cannot seem to see beyond their own pain and struggles and because of this, they don't see those who truly need help. There are heartbreaking scenes in this book, but they are essential to go through because it is a forcing of the reader to notice the pain of others - in a way that many of us probably do not in real life. This book provides an amazing lesson to each of us and is inspiring. Stop, open our eyes, help those around us, see people from their perspective instead of judging.Who would enjoy this book? Readers that enjoy literary fiction, character studies or societal observations . This book is not an adventure tale nor is it a story with a beginning, middle and end. It is a window into the lives of a small town - the readers get a glimpse and then it is over. Readers looking for a tight resolution, a beautiful and satisfying end, and the triumph of good over evil should not attempt Casual Vacancy. They will be disappointed. This is not a book to be skimmed, but instead it is one to be immersed in and it takes awhile to get through. So patient readers are needed as well.

I will not be holding her in any godlike regard. I have read The Casueal Vacancy with clear eyes. I understand the risk an author takes to offer something new to their public, and so I commend Rowling for that.I listened to the book and it didn't get really interesting until hour 8 (there were 18).  I feel that with an aggressive editor, Rowling could have easily cut a major percentage of this book without extensive loss.  She just explained everything and everyone in much detail.  Perhaps a little too much.The story featured in The Casual Vacancy is pretty basic, what happens to a town when one of the most important people on the council dies?  What happens when people feel their way of life is threatened and will stop at nothing to keep everything the same?  Basic story - strange, irksome,  and at times compelling characters.As I listened, the first thing I thought was - wow the men in this book are severely flawed idiots that I wouldn't like to meet....Then as time went on I thought - wow, the women in the book are severely flawed idiots that I wouldn't like to meet.I've seen complaints about Rowling's character development, but I honestly don't think she has a problem there; I think her character development is fine,fantastic even but I think we are quite uncomfortable with the characters she has developed.  The thing you come to ask yourself is - are we are as a people really like this?  And I think the sad truth is - yes, we are quite pathetic.  This can be a quite humbling realization to grasp.  I actually wouldnt mind knowing what happens to Andrew and Gaia and the others.  I found that I thought of the Crystals of the world way after the book was done.  I would definitely read Rowling again.

Barry Fairbrother has died and left a hole in the main frame of the political dynasty that has captured Pagford.First off I want to say that I have read a number of books from authors who both wrote YA and then an adult book and authors who have well known series and try a different story.  I grew up reading Harry Potter and was thrilled at the idea of seeing what else J.K. Rowling could come up with.  The Casual Vacancy is a story that is 70% masterful character development and 30% plot.  If you are looking to read a mystery then this isn't the story for you.  The Casual Vacancy is a snap shot of a small town going through political change and how Barry Fairbrother effected the town and her people.  The characters are wonderful and have very distinct voices and stories that you can get into.  It is very slow at first as you get to known each character but it picks up quickly once the stories are worked through and you get to know each of these people in the town.I did enjoy this novel but I am unsure if I would pick it up a second time.  There were times I forgot that J.K. Rowling wrote this.  Her narrative is similar to Harry Potter but much more adult.  There are a good amount of vulgar language and sexual situations so I would not recommend this to a younger crowd who loved Harry Potter.  It is natural to want that adventure novel that was Harry Potter but this is a 100% new concept.  I was able to put that aside as I read this book because of my past readings from other authors but I still felt like the book could have done more.Overall it is worth picking up and reading if you enjoy J.K. Rowling and want to see what else she can write but if you are expecting anything like Harry Potter this isn't the book from you.  If you are expecting a mystery novel who done it this isn't for you.  The type of reader who would enjoy this book is those who enjoy a less dramatic soap opera (or Desperate Housewives) of one of those reality shows that follow people around in their daily lives.  At the end you will be glad you read it and recommend it to a friend but I doubt you will want to read it a second time.",3,"11 20, 2012",1353369600,"[0, 1]"

It is:Very intricate. There are many parts that connect and I could definitely see myself re-reading it to get a better idea of all the connections.A study in characters. All of the characters are extremely real. It is perhaps my favorite thing about the whole book. There is absolutely no fantasy about these characters. They are real people.It is perhaps the first book in a really long time that I&#8217;ve read that is in 3rd person omniscient. Even with books like those in A Song of Ice and Fire, each chapter is limited to only that character&#8217;s POV. In The Casual Vacancy, POV&#8217;s can switch within a chapter.In explaining this book to my friends, I used the following analogy:&#8220;You know Miley Cyrus? How she was Hannah Montana and a Disney star? Well when she wanted to break free from that become an adult artist, how she started posing nude and getting caught with drugs, and singing racier songs? That&#8217;s what it seems like J.K. Rowling is trying to do with The Casual Vacancy; really show that she&#8217;s not just a children&#8217;s book author.&#8221;Maybe that&#8217;s an unfair statement, but out of the various books I&#8217;ve read recently, I haven&#8217;t read one with as many curse words and some vulgarity in it without it being explicitly that kind of book. At first, it was very shocking and jarring.Additionally, the style in the beginning had me confused as to who was who. There are so many characters and the way the POV switches, it takes a while to really get involved with each of the different characters. It&#8217;s a book that would benefit from a list of characters in the beginning, like some of Agatha Christie&#8217;s books. It made it tough going for the first 50% of the book. It was a book that went up hill to then suddenly race to the bottom. It&#8217;s that race to the bottom that had me improving my opinion of the book.That&#8217;s why this is a hard one to rate. The beginning was like three stars for me&#8230;I liked it. I didn&#8217;t really like it, and it was well written enough to be better than just okay. But the end, the revelation of all things being connected&#8230;well that bumps it to four stars for me. I feel a bit guilty for whatever reason not giving it five stars, but the meandering in the beginning didn&#8217;t match the acceleration at the end.",4,"06 13, 2014",1402617600,"[0, 0]"

Rowling was going to be writing a book geared towards adults, especially so soon after she wrapped up the Harry Potter series. The Casual Vacancy is definitely for adults, and if parents are wondering if it's a book that their children who love Harry Potter can read, I would definitely say no. It deals with very strong adult themes, includes swearing, drug and sexual references.But looking at it as an adult book, it is wonderful. You are introduced to a community, and become familiar with its ins and outs. You see how it is run and the people that live there. You are able to catch a glimpse into their lives.For the people complaining about how many characters are in this books: have you heard of Tolstoy? War and Peace had a slew of characters, all of which were important to the story. Rowling has the same thing. Sure there are a bunch of characters and it gets hard to keep track of everyone. If you asked me, I wouldn't be able to name them all. But they are all equally important to the story she told. They added complexitiy to the story. It shows how complex this world is, at any given moment, during and given point in time, no matter what is happening around us, everyone is dealing with their own problems. I loved being able to delve into more than one person's life and at the end of the book, I found myself wanting to know more about what the future held for everyone in the story, especially the younger generation.I thought it was a superb book, and when I wasn't reading it, I was wondering about it.",5,"01 11, 2013",1357862400,"[0, 0]"

I like the character development -- she is indeed a master and getting inside a character's skin and showing what makes him or her tick. This certainly must capture modern life in a small British community.  I am hardly an expert on that, but, lets face it, J.K. Rowlings certainly is. It matters little, though, where the story is set.The book tells an age-old story of class warfare wherein the ""haves"" want to move the ""have nots"" off their radar screen and maintain an idyllic world, albeit populated with souls as damaged as those they wish to avoid. This primal fear of ""the other"" plays out through the story, and is one all of us must face as well. I can't find a character in this book that I actually like. There are some I pity, and some I shake my head in disgust over. I am savoring this novel, reading it slowly and carefully --not at my usual breakneck speed, which brings me to the point I wish to make. I love the story, I love the character development, but I wish J.K. Rowlings had told her tale in a few less pages. I do find my brain wandering off to the grocery list now and again, and that should not be.I think it is great, though that this writer has moved on after the Harry Potter saga.

I have, in fact, tried to emulate her ease of conveyance of ideas and descriptions in my own writing.This book, however, was a bomb. It is a tawdry, tedious, non-noteworthy little British soap opera.  The best thing that can be said for it is to point to Rowling's descriptive powers of observation of the mental processes of the characters about which she writes. She can describe a physical, or psychological event in clear, concise verbiage that I have never seen any other writer pull off.That being said, the main plot, if one can even call it that has way too many characters not easily tied together in this overlong, exceedingly boring tale of nothingness.  It is not a social statement, but an elongated look at extreme ordinariness that simply goes on forever.

If I had not known it was Rowling I would not have guessed it.  Clearly she can write and this book shows that she has some pretty great range beyond the Potterverse. I liked the butterfly effect concept that runs through it, the notion that one event triggers off a sequence that flows through the rest of the story. I thought the characters were pretty engaging for the most part although I thought a few didn't bring much to the table and some were a little one-dimensional (why did we need Maureen?  she isn't very relevant and only kind of becomes marginally significant at the end).  The whole Gavin character was a little baffling too other than she felt like we needed a character who pretty much always gets things wrong.  The one thing I did not expect from the book was that it, for me, was a gut punch throughout.  Some reviews thought this was black comedy or tragicomedy but I didn't feel like the humorous scenes balanced the drama and tragedy that runs from the first chapter on.  I did like the small town where everyone is out to ruin everyone angle.  That was an intriguing point and how all politics is local.  Some reviewer called this book 500 pages of socialist propaganda.  That just made me giggle.  I think you know what you're going to get with Rowling now that she has enough money to own the planet so didn't really get why they were so upset (assume this was all about the clinic and how the town was trying to turn its back on the Fields).The characters that did engage me were Krystal, Andrew, Stuart, Samantha and Howard (to a lesser degree).  I think the movie is already in production but I would cast the father from Harry Potter movies for the role of Howard (is he still alive?).  He would do great in that role.  The Krystal character was great and I was not necessarily shocked she died at the end but didn't think it was necessary.  Robbie dying was a little predictable to me.  The Krystal death scene was a little unbelievable to me.  The police are already on scene yet they just let a teenage girl barricade herself in a house and give her plenty of time to commit suicide before they think they might want to check on her.  Where did they get their crisis intervention training?  That part took me out of the story a bit even though I thought the last few lines of the death scene were beautifully written.Fats was an interesting character to me although I had a hard time picturing him in my mind.  I did like the idea of a teenage boy who thinks he is wise beyond his years having to finally deal with consequences of his actions and realizing that life/world/people cannot be lumped into two simple categories.  Thought his character was well played through most of the book.The wives all trying to undermine the husbands was fine but I think more of a play on just a basic theme of &#34;there are a million different stories out there in the naked city, here are a few of them.&#34;At the end though it seems no one finds redemption and I was just left with a horribly depressing but well written book.  Some reviews said it just ended but I disagree in the sense that I didn't feel like there was anything unresolved it just was a down note for me from beginning to end.  Not that every book I read has to be Happy Slappy Hero Pup but I could have used a little more lightness to the book.  Writing absolutely drew me in and I was engaged throughout with the small stumbles at the end.  It also surprised me a little that she got away from what I consider her strength in the Potter books which was writing a mystery.  I know she has written some since under the pen name but there was no great mystery in this book just lots of character development which I liked.  Overall, I gave it four stars but really probably closer to 3.5 (but they don't give you that option on Amazon).  I felt better for having read it but not sure how long it will stay with me.

It took me much longer to get through than a normal read.This is so much a departure from Rowling's previous works it is almost equivalent to if Steven King starting to write children's books.While the writing is impeccable this is not an easy book to get into. Most of the characters are awful it was hard to find anyone to root for. Seemingly the most likeable character with the most redeeming qualities is the guy that dies in the beginning of the story and even his wife is upset that he seemed to care about everything else in there little town more that their family. Everyone else is so flawed; petty gossips, unhappy marriages, heroin users, abusive family members the list goes on and on. This is not a happy story.It is totally character driven many small stories interweaved together. All of the characters in this little town are connected by minor details throughout the book which is a feat. If you are like me and like things to be wrapped up at the end of the book this is not for you. Most of the problems brought up are never resolved completely by the end. There are some minor resolutions to a few situations but overall many strings are left hanging open.The character I like the best was Andrew Price the awkward teenager with acne who is infatuated with the new girl in town. He comes from a home with an abusive father and tries to take the brunt of the anger from him to protect his enabling mother and little brother. I was also pulling for Krystal, ah poor Krys. Mother addicted to heroine currently in and out of recovery she has a 3 year old brother Robbie that she is desperate to keep in her family. She is trying so hard to keep her mom straight and her dysfunctional family together. Her story is absolutely tragic. There are some bright lights at the end of the tunnel. A few characters that learned life lessons and might have become better people overall. There are also those that learned no lessons went backwards as people or remained just as awful as they had always been.If you like true to life type stories and character studies than this is probably something you would enjoy. I will say it isn't my cup of tea and had it been written by anyone else I probably wouldn't have made it through the first hundred pages.

Holland ""rodholland""","If you want an engaging tale about the underside of a small British village, this is it","I have not read any reviews of this book and will not read any until I finish my own review. I also did not read a description of the book either, I wanted to leave myself without preconceptions, and let Rowling stand on her own two feet and be able to give an honest review without bias.First, this is definitely not Harry Potter, this is literature, or a reasonable facsimile there of. This novel is less accessible to American readers partially because of its intricacy with the details of how a small British town/village works, as well as many other smatterings of how the British social system works.To pick up on everything, I think you would need to be slightly familiar with the NHS (National Healthcare System), shopping on the high street, the British proclivity for petty theft, the structure of small British villages, the bus system, British lack of talent at cooking, stratification of the social structure, the charging for local calls by the minute when you're on the internet (they're still doing that?),...and on and on. There are literally dozens of things that happen in the novel that would go unnoticed by an American or not translate well.One might complain about the vulgar language in the book. I remember when I first dealt with the Brits in Saudi Arabia and discovered that they had one more article in the English language than we had: a, an, the, (Amazon flagged the F-Bomb...even with *'s).  Sadly, I can vouch that the ""grammar"" and ""vocabulary"" in this book is correct with the respect to the lower class Brits (and even some middle class).Given she was a single mum (mom for us Americans) and on the dole while she was writing Harry Potter, I wonder if we're seeing part of her view on the public dole and a lot of the people on the dole (i.e. the dole should be a helping hand, and not a support system for habitual druggies).I also noted a lot of references to the classed society of the Brits which doesn't translate all that well to Americans, maybe more so if you come from the east coast rather than the west as I do.There are some sections with so much beautiful irony its amazing.Much of this is narrative, but Rowling uses it effectively, and I don't feel too separated from what's going on. Her characters and their interactions are fairly engaging, and I did't have a problem getting involved with the characters. However, the characters may drive many people wild. They're pathetic, every last one of them, and clearly designed that way on purpose. There's not a single character that you would want to cheer for, except maybe the dead man.Where we were used to defined good and evil in Harry Potter, very few characters can be labeled as evil or nearly evil in this book. Less evolved and crass is a better description, or maybe ""wuss"" and ""not a wuss"".There's definitely a shotgun blast of subtexts going on about the British system: The Dole, British dentistry, lower class Brits, middle class Brits, people who disregard their doctors advice, addicts, British social stratification, obnoxious teenage boys, trashy teenage girls, there's something for everyone here to needle, pick at, and take the mickey out of.If you want a happy tale, this ain't it.... but if you want an engaging tale about the underside of a small British village where the plot doesn't become clear until nearly the very end, than this is an excellent tale.

The sudden death of Barry Fairbrother is the event around which the story evolves.Ms. Rowling's knowledge of human nature and gift for story-telling is rarely equaled in the authorship of literature.  This reviewer classes her alongside Dickens and Trollope.The story is not pretty but it is not such as should repel even a gentle reader.  It is filled with characters that few other than Ms. Rowling are gifted enough to construct.  And any observant, intelligent resident of a small town will marvel at the skill with which Rowling depicts Pagford in all of its submerged but real personal distress and prejudices.You the prospective reader of Casual Vacancy should not be put off by the surprising number of negative reviews of this book.  You will have missed much that is good if you allow negativity to influence you in this matter.  And don't believe that certain classes and age-groupings do not speak with the crudeness of many depicted in the book. Perhaps not your neighbors but they are out there.ADDENDUM;  OCT. 29, 2012I just finished re-reading Casual Vacancy.  I did so because I enjoyed my first reading a few weeks ago so much.  My 2nd reading did not change my mind about its quality.  It truly rates 5 stars.  This reviewer only rarely re-reads fiction.  I mention this to illustrate the degree to which I liked the book.Though I usually avoid books that are downers I do not consider Casual Vacancy to be such.  Rowling's writing is so good and she has such a fine touch in building fictional characters that I hardly noticed the salty language.  Rowling made her unhappy characters and their experiences so interesting that I was attracted to them and paid no attention to the down-side of the story.  Not many authors are able to do that for me.I suppose that the many dissatisfied readers are attuned to Harry Potter fantasy and to seeing him survive and prosper after so many hazardous adventures and so much unpleasant life at home.  (I did read all but the last two Potter books).  But masses of real people live lives that are little more than exercises in survival and a series of grasps at a bit of passing fun.Your advanced-age, well- educated reviewer has had jobs that took him into many, many, MANY homes occupied by destitute and/or desperate people some of them resembling the Weedons.  I can tell you that Rowling knows that of which she writes. And she knows her social classes and the proclivities of those who occupy them.I'll repeat that Rowling is up there with Trollope and Dickens.  I am pleased that the world recognizes and pays her properly for her expertise.",5,"10 14, 2012",1350172800,"[4, 5]"

I was excited to read this book, even knowing it was not about Hogwarts.  I was disappointed, but NOT because it isn't another Harry Potter.  The book is very dark and really a huge downer.  Harry Potter was often times dark and dealt with death.  However, the Harry Potter novels remained hopeful.  There was a light at the end of a tunnel and a continuing belief in the ultimate goodness in people.  I did not find any kind of hope in the Casual Vacancy and this is what bothered me the most.  Also, Harry Potter is full of memorable, likeable characters.  I did not find any of the characters here very likable.  A few I felt very sorry for (Krystal, Sukhvindar) but there were none I was really rooting for.  Most of the characters were desperately selfish and almost pitiful (like Samantha, Gavin).  All this said, Rowling is a tremendous writer.  Despite my dislike of the characters, I finished the book and found parts of it compelling.  I will qualify all this by saying I don't really read ""sad"" novels.  If that's your thing, you might like this.  I felt very blue after finishing the book.

I had a slow start because I am normally a mystery, thriller advocate.  Soon, I was swept up into all the characters' personalities, lives, conflicts.  This is not a romance novel..... it is about individuals' shortcomings, misunderstanding of intent and subsequent fall-outs.  The frailty of the human spirit, the pettiness, fears, cruelty of the human psyche and how all of these affect people's lives.  Ms. Rowling's writing skill is so remarkable.  She has taken a group of characters and their lives and placed them into a clear order and class structure within the confines of a small town in England.

It could just be personal bias, but I HATE books like that.  While I watched them parade their stupid, narrow-minded, vicious and selfish lives across their limited stage, I just couldn't reconcile them with the fabulous, multi-faceted characters of Hogwarts.

It's like Rowling went out of her way to write a ""serious, adult book"" and ended up trying way, way too hard.  It has all the cliches of a literary novel--nasty characters, slow, tragic plot and somebody commits suicide at the end--without any of the interest.  A good literary novel might have ugly characters and a very slow tragedy for a plot, but it also makes you think, and see the world in a different way.  This didn't.

Perry ""amateur philosopher""","A major work for mature adults...but not recommended for minors.","""If God made the country and man made the town, then the devil made the little country town.""--Author unknownThe Casual Vacancy (2012), J. K. Rowling's venture into adult fiction, describes the denizens of Pagford, a pretty little country town situated in the West Country (southwestern England), near Yarvil, a larger city to the north. [Note: Both Pagford and Yarvil are fictional creations.]To tourists visiting Pagford, it appears to be an idyllic place in which to live. But things are not always what they seem. The town teems with dysfunctional people--narrow-minded, untruthful, full of malice and spite. News travels fast in Pagford; there's a lot of busybody gossiping and there are ample reasons for the gossip.A sixty-year grudge-feud has raged and festered between Pagford and Yarvil. Two bones of contention are ""the Fields"" (a squalid slum between the two towns) and the financial viability of the Bellchapel Addiction Clinic which, among other services, dispenses methadone to heroin addicts.A ""casual vacancy"" refers to the resignation or death of a member of the town council. When good-hearted Barry Fairbrother dies of an aneurysm of the brain, candidates for his vacant office are thrown into a political struggle between those who are ""pro"" and ""con"" concerning the Fields and the Bellchapel Addiction Clinic.Pagford is hard-pressed to elect a candidate worthy to fill the shoes of the deceased council member, especially when ""The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother"" makes periodic appearances on the Pagford Parish Council's website, revealing scandalous secrets that set the gossipy network buzzing.A central motif of A Casual Vacancy is class struggle, reminiscent of works by authors such as Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Elizabeth Gaskell. One is pained by how the poor people of the Fields are marginalized and alienated by an upper class who disparage their depressed conditions.There are so many characters in this novel--most of them human, all-too-human--that a chart of who is related to whom, and of their political agendas, would have been helpful. Suffice it to say that the characters are well-developed and the dialogue, although at times eyebrow-raising, is expertly done.Quite different from the seven volumes of Ms. Rowling's Harry Potter series, A Casual Vacancy is definitely adult fare. It contains off-color language and erotic ""confrontations"" that are not recommended for one's pre-teen daughter (or, for that matter, pre-teen son). Mature readers may find Rowling's experiment in catharsis more amusing than offensive.The novel ends in catastrophe, with the tragic death of two of the main characters. It would be a disservice to insert a spoiler revealing their identities.",5,"07 11, 2014",1405036800,"[0, 0]"
"0316228532","A3URCC2KJNGK92","R S","It's not Harry Potter, which is a good thing","After getting this book as a gift for Christmas 2012 and procrastinating on reading it, I finally finished it last night after slowly reading it during a period of a few months. The immediate revelation is that this book is not Harry Potter 8, it's not fantasy or teen fiction, it's harrowing literary fiction that delves deep into human nature, and through a cast of diverse and intelligently-constructed characters, shows how all of us can be led to resent our fellow humans. The plot is somewhat threadbare, which is fine; it develops in much the same way a season of Mad Men does, with the bulk of the material exploring and developing the characters and showing us the facets of their personalities, before presenting two satisfying climaxes near the end where, finally, the stakes are raised for these characters and we glimpse them in their most vulnerable states. The characters in the book are very strong; Fats, Gaia, Suhkvinder, and Andrew have replaced the main trio from Harry Potter as my favorite Rowling teenage characters. Reading their subplots makes me wish that Harry Potter had had more swearing and sex, because Rowling masterfully portrays these adolescents without resorting to hyperbole or cliche, and it would've been awesome to see a Rated R conversation between Harry and Draco or Ron and Hermione instead of the PG talk of the Harry Potter series. If there's a weak link in the cast, it's the character of the Weedons. I won't spoil their placement in the society of Pagford, but after 400 pages it was slightly tiresome to keep coming back to them in the exact same position that they'd always been in when I was more interested in the development of the rest of the characters. However, the Weedons feature heavily in the finale and this makes up for it somewhat. The book is well-written, will make you exercise the dictionary function on your Kindle unless your vocabulary is much stronger than mine, and will alternatively make you bust up laughing with Rowling's dry, dark sense of humor, and cry for the characters, not with artificial tragedy (of which there's a little bit in this book) but because Rowling makes them so achingly human that you can't help sympathize yet be annoyed by them at the same time.

This thing can go sit on bookshelves with the likes of John Grisham and other rich people cranking out meaningless dramas.

There was some compelling themes that could have been explored further (the clinic, ""the light of God shone from every soul"") but ultimately went unresolved.

I've noticed that the reviews are mixed, and about half either loved the book or half didn't. I'd like to add up front that I did not read anything in the Harry Potter series because I'm not a fan of that genre. I saw a few of the movies and I yawned through them. Once again, because I'm not a fan of that particular genre.But I am a fan of J.K. Rowling now and it's all because of The Casual Vacancy. I've read where a lot of people didn't like the fact that there are so many characters. I found this aspect not only refreshing, but also something most writers aren't capable of doing. As a writer I know how difficult it is to weave multiple characters into a plot and I don't do it often because it's so difficult to keep the story flowing and at the same time keep reminding the reader who the characters are. And I didn't have any issues following all the characters in The Casual Vacancy. In fact, what kept me reading and thinking about the book was what was going to happen to these characters. And there's really nothing extraordinary about them, and yet you wind up caring about them.I will admit that I started this book a while ago, and then I put it aside because I got busy with other things. But that's something else I loved about it. I do that with authors like John Irving sometimes. I'll start the book, get to a certain point, and then stop reading for a few weeks...even months sometimes...and then come back to it right where I left off. And after all that time, if the book is good enough, those characters and the plot are with me to a certain extent. I can't say that about many other books I've read in my lifetime. And that's because a book like The Casual Vacancy only comes along once in a while.I noticed a lot of people compared TCV to Peyton Place. I would go so far as to say that it did remind me of Peyton Place, but I don't think Grace Metalious was anywhere near the author J.K. Rowling is. If I had to compare Petyon Place to anything nowadays I would probably compare it to Fifty Shades of Grey instead of The Casual Vacancy because I think Metalious and E.L. James are probably on the same level as far as author skills go. And that's by no means a slur to either of them. They both wrote great books and people loved them.But there's a literary quality to The Casual Vacancy that crosses that painfully thin line into mainstream commercial that truly interested me. From page one, I found myself caring about the people of Pagford and wondering what was going to happen to them. I also found reading about lifestyles in the UK just as interesting. In many ways, it's not all that different from the US, and Pagford could have been my little town, New Hope, in Bucks County, PA....from the politics to the class warfare to the little secrets going on behind the scenes.What some readers have commented on is that there's a dark side to this book, and I just didn't see that. There's a realistic side. I saw that very plainly. But I didn't see all the darkness and gloom. Like I said, it's real and sometimes it's intense. And sometimes there's some wit and humor worked into the book when you don't expect it. It's also gossipy in the way many small towns are. But I just didn't see all that darkness and gloom others talked about.Rowling could have held back in some instances, especially with regard to the male teenage characters. And yet she didn't, and I found this aspect of the book more like a character study. It surprised me, too. As someone who never had read Harry Potter, I honestly didn't think she had it in her. This is why I didn't want to get into an overall plot description with this review. So many others have done that well in other reviews, and I wanted to add a few different thoughts...if that's possible...for readers who might be thinking of reading The Casual Vacancy but aren't sure if it's the book for them.All I can say if that if you like things glossed over and hidden, and you're not a fan of really reading about some of the more intense things in life, this might not be the book for you. If you tend to take the more difficult aspects of life seriously and you carry images around in your head for a long time, this book might not be for you either. But if you are interested in reading something that gets into the realities and complications of what life is like today, I think you'll be pleasantly surprsed at how J.K. Rowling managed to pull this off. And I hope there are more books like this one in her future.",5,"02 27, 2013",1361923200,"[1, 1]"

It involves an empty seat for the town council, I can only assume. But everyone seems too stupid to realize that the seat is up for reelection now. It isn't until halfway through the book that someone realizes, ""HEY! we can fight over this seat and an all-out war will ensue and ..."" You get the drift I image. It just moved way way too slow for me and I couldn't find a reason to pick it up anymore and finish it. Maybe later, but no.The characters, oh the characters are horrible. There wasn't one general character that I enjoyed of felt that I would enjoy when I put the book down. It was just a cluster of horrible and even worse they all are so self-centered and delusional it's sickening. All of the characters really just use each other to position themselves better politically or to better their standing with the community. The lot of shallow characters in this book is far from what I expected out of J.K. Rowling. C'mon you can do a lot better, than this.As well, this is labeled as Adult, and realistically this is no where near an adult book. Its more of a young adult book, with a few mentions of sex and condoms that look like those white grubs you can use for fishing. I hated the labeling of this book, it's not at all what I was expecting. If I could have claimed to be an adult when I was 12 by simply mentioning condoms and sex, than I believe the world would have a lot less teenagers and more immature bastard children running around. This book isn't even close to the label it had.The environment was confusing as well, it focuses around Pagford and some suburbs. I spent most of my time re-reading the paragraphs trying to understand what was being conveyed. I felt that I missed most of the setting or it just wasn't described in a manner that I could visualize. As well when I finally understood the setting for the character that was speaking for the moment; the character changes. There is no chapters, there is days and in one day nearly every character has a section in which they give their perspective on the days happenings. Its very disruptive to the story and I was left with a complete emptiness when the character swapped. It just isn't something I enjoy seeing in a book, there was no reason to swap that way.Now when I picked up this book I looked around at fellow other bloggers and reviewers to see what they thought, and generally it's a mixed review. Some love the book and some utterly hate it. I would view my stance on this book less than neutral. I don't hate this completely, it more or less just isn't my style of book and I couldn't get past those issues, and it's generally not just me who has those issues but most of those who dislike this book share the issues.",1,"02 1, 2013",1359676800,"[0, 1]"
"0316228532","A2Z4NPJ1WAWDE7","R. Zoellner","I'll never see this in a high school library","It's clear that J.K. Rowling is done with unfolding the shining wonder of the magical world.  She plunged also into the darkest depths of her magical world, and is in need of a change of pace from that as well.  The Casual Vacancy is her exploration of the banal and ordinary, the flat concrete grey in contrast to the brilliant chiaroscuro of the light and dark of her Harry Potter books.  There is no hero, no villain, in this book, but rather a small town full of characters of varying importance and qualities.  Their concerns could not be any more petty and unimportant to the greater world.  Everyone hates each other in The Casual Vacancy, and the most positive reaction I felt about any character was pity.  The rest of them I despised more and more as events progressed.  They all enjoyed each other's suffering, and I could hardly care, either, and yet Rowling still managed to make me cry at the end.The only moment I thought this mundane book could possibly have existed in the same England as Harry Potter was when I read this quote:  ""People in Krystal's mother's circle died prematurely with such frequency that they might have been involved in some secret war of which the rest of the world knew nothing.""  Of course, this turns out to be because they are clearly all heroin addicts, drug dealers, or some other kind of unspecified criminal, not witches and wizards.  However, the brilliancy and quality of Rowling's writing skills shines all the brighter for the dreary subject matter.  For example, a quote:  ""Kay noticed a used condom glistening in the grass beside her feet, like the gossamer cocoon of some huge grub.""  Nobody has ever or will ever describe this particular piece of trash the same way, and I am impressed because she both highlights its unnnoticed beauty and accentuates the general disgust felt by the viewer in the same sentence.I read Rowling's Harry Potter books because I like my fiction to be an escape from reality.  This book is not like that; it is a reminder of all the things in reality that we seek to escape.  Reading The Casual Vacancy made me feel like a voyeur, spying on the lives of these townspeople, and privy to even their inner thoughts.  Rowling does an excellent job of managing her large cast of characters, and quickly introducing them as individuals to the reader, both via the internal feelings each has, and the reactions and descriptions of them by others.  If I were to re-title this book, I would call it Sins of their Fathers, which is at once more memorable than The Casual Vacancy, and far less intriguing.  If you've overlooked the Harry Potter books because you think they are childish, I think Rowling wrote this one for you.  I imagine you'll enjoy the vulgarity more than I did.",5,"10 6, 2012",1349481600,"[5, 8]"

Now I want to first say that I can't really give this book a totally 100% fair review because I could not finish it. I really couldn't even get through half of it, I got through about 38% of the book before I had to just call it quits.That being out of the way now I will say that this book was horribly boring to me. Yes, I did initially look at this book because J.K. Rowling wrote it however, I knew it was going to be nothing like Harry Potter. I figured that because Rowling is a fantastic author it would be a good book. I was wrong, so very wrong. The first chapter was decent but it didn't really grasp my attention to the book.The best part of the book that I found was the part that involved Krystal Wheedon. Unfortunately, Krystal's part of the story was not able to keep my attention. I was discussing it with my sister who was also trying to reading the book and we came to the conclusion that if the book really would have captured our attention we would have been staying up late and attached to the book, just like other books we have been.There are a lot of characters in the book and they are well described, almost too well and too much. The town of Pagford seems like a sleepy town with a bustling political system in which most of the main characters would like a piece of the action since Barry Fairbrother died. Speaking of Barry Fairbrother, I would classify him as a main character although he dies in the first couple of pages. Weird, right?I won't discourage anyone to read the book, you might like it. Heck, you might really love the book but it just wasn't my cup of tea.I was not impressed by J.K. Rowling's first adult novel.",1,"10 8, 2013",1381190400,"[0, 1]"

Rowling to try a totally different audience category since she had tremendous success in the children/teen areas.  However, it also shows that she is willing and confidence to try it without worrying about the result.  She really can afford to write whatever she likes and that makes this book very personal (to what she likes to write about and what she experienced or witnessed in her life).We certainly miss her unique capabilities on creating the Harry Potter series and hoping that she would continue on that path.  Harry Potter had motivated millions of children to read, which was a huge success consider we are living in a world of video games and movies.  I still hope that she will create another fantasy series (friendly for all ages) that will lead more children to read and even to write their own stories.

But I owed it JK Rowling to see it through and after about 100 pages, certain characters and situations started to entertain me. As the story progressed it got more interesting. My nitpicks were the slow start and the amount of characters to remember. There are 6 families and every family has at least three people in it, and all interconnect in one way or another in this small town. It was hard to remember who was who, especially with names like Simon and Colin, Terri and Tessa.On the whole though, once I could get a grasp on the characters and who belonged where (I should have drawn a wee diagram) it was good.

While some of these characters are sympathetic, and some fill the role of &#34;bad guys,&#34; they all have at least a little of each characteristic, and Rowling takes pains to make them all understandable, if not likable.There's quite a bit of sex, some of it quite explicit, and none of it romanticized. The depiction of the sexuality of the teenage boys is quite effective--somewhat oddly, the sexuality of the teenage girls is treated with more distance. There is also a throwaway lesbian adult character who seems like she might be there to check off a box.Pacing is a bit of an issue. The book takes a long time to introduce all the characters, and while it's doing that, it moves slowly.

Sadly, it seems, the detractors have a valid point.The basic concept of the story regarding the fighting going on around the vacancy in the local council was very solid and could have made for a very funny farce.  Or if she had concentrated on the SocioEconomic element of the Weedon family and The Fields estate, then it would have been a more serious and interesting story.  It felt like she had these two separate ideas for a novel and merged them together into one, so doing neither story justice in the telling.It took me a couple of hundred pages just to get to know which character was which as there were too many introduced all at once.  I didn't feel like I actually got to know (or indeed care) very well for any of the characters, which detracted from any enjoyment I could have had from this book.It ended up being about 200 pages too long for me which, I believe, was caused by my point above of it actually being two separate novels merged into one.I still gave it 2 out of 5 points as the author is, without a doubt, a talented author and has great ideas for stories but this one just did not give me much enjoyment and I would not recommend to anyone to waste their time reading it.

And i think she is a good writer, all things considered.That said, I wanted to like this book more than I did.  It had what appeared to be a simple premise:  in a small English town, a very popular, nice man dies suddenly, leaving a vacancy on the local council.  There are two factions trying to gain control of that council, and the fate of the local drug clinic hangs in the balance.  As the story goes on, there are a lot of layers in intertwined relationships, as people take sides in the election to fill the seat.There are a lot of characters, too, and the the story is written in third person omniscient.  And it's simply too much.  The transitions between one persons POV to another's are clunky, and the narration has to constantly TELL you how and what a particular character is feeling because you'd never be able to keep them straight otherwise.  And because there are so many characters, some of them related, the author felt the need to have every single one of them interact in some was with every other character, which often seemed contrived.My main disappointment, however, was in the fact that not one of the characters was likable.  The teenagers were all spawns of Satan, the wives were gossips, the husbands were weak or abusive, and everyone secretly hated each other.  Everyone was sarcastic, mean, hypocritical, hostile, and insulting.  They were unpleasant to read about, and I did, from time to time, start hoping for a natural disaster to wipe out the village completely.  Maybe if the story were told from only one or two characters' points of view (letting the reader figure out everyone's biases and issues as the novel went on, instead of constantly being outright told) or maybe if the characters had at least some redeeming features, maybe then it would have been a good read.I was relieved when I got to the end, which was sad but entirely without emotional resonance.

"0316228532","A1E39J0734IR7O","Sean P. Endress","""The books that the world calls immoral are the books that show the world its own shame."" - Oscar Wilde","Rowling's ""The Casual Vacancy"" is, in some way, indeed aimed at her prior audience. The children that grew up with Harry and company are now in their early twenties, the demographic which this reviewer believes will have the most interest in this work.Rowling maintains her direct writing style, eschewing flowery language for precision that can hit just the right humorous note or strike like an angry arrow. Brought to the world of adult literature, it gives a very clear, no-nonsense view of reality, as she explores humanity's darkest corners. From the confusion of puberty to the dark, pit-like trap that is drug addiction, Rowling brings all to light without bias or judgment, but rather allows almost every character to appear both sympathetic and yet terribly, terribly flawed.For this story has no heroes. This is not a venture in the battles of good and evil or black and white, this is simply an exploration into the grey and greyer world of the mundane. There is precious little plot to speak of, and it moves along at a snail's pace - it exists only as the character actions drive it themselves, and it is the characters that this novel highlights.Some are turned away by the novel's harsh language, explicit sexuality, or views into the lifestyles of ""the depraved"" (to quote another reviewer). However, the reality of our world is that children come up with new, colorful ways to curse at each other each day. What adults refuse to teach them about their bodies, they are more than happy to learn for themselves. And whether you pity them, fear them, love them, or despise them, the kinds of people you don't want to associate with will always exist, somewhere around the corner or across town. For bringing these things to light in a light that does not judge, but rather illuminates and offers respect, Rowling deserves every accolade.Her greatest achievement may be in her parallels of childhood and adulthood. As the petty (and at times, not-so-petty) conflicts of childhood play out, they are mirrored by the equally frivolous battles of adulthood - and yet, to the characters, each event seems to mean everything in the world. This is because, when one is inside their own novel, everything -does- matter, with unwavering importance, even if in the long term, it's a tiny flash in the pan.Rowling drags the human condition into the light. At times it laughs uproariously, at times it is reduced to kicking and screaming, but it is constantly compelling and accurate. While the subject matter evokes the classics, the style is gorgeously and unabashedly her own. It can, at times, drag as one finds favorites in some subplots and less interest in others, but all are sufficiently intriguing to maintain interest, and rewarding in the end.However, this book should come with a disclaimer: This is not for those offended by reality, or for those who fear the taboo. This is not for people who are afraid to recognize their own flaws in a book, who cannot withstand true self-reflection. ""The Casual Vacancy"" is for the adventurous, the open, the kind of people willing to view plainly the nature of reality before them, and are prepared to change it.",5,"10 3, 2012",1349222400,"[0, 0]"

"0316228532","A28RRDJ3NSRIFQ","Seymour Hamilton","An Engaging Chronicle","JK Rowling's A Casual Vacancy is a compelling novel that deals with the tension between the smug inhabitants of a postcard-perfect little English town, and the marginalised, welfare-dependent and often criminal people who live in the neighbouring public housing estate.The book begins with the town councillor who crossed  this economic and social divide in part because he went to the town's school.  He has maintained an uneasy peace in the municipal border wars, which shatters into deviousness and skullduggery as people take sides in an election to fill the ""casual vacancy"" caused by his death.  (Hardly a spoiler: he dies on page 4.)A Casual Vacancy is more specifically located in English society than the Harry Potter stories, which may confuse North American readers who are not familiar with British notions of social and economic class.  However, people who read British mystery and crime novels, or who watch the occasional British TV show will have little difficulty.  This is a socially conscious novel that makes us uncomfortable, whether we are British or not, because the characters, their motivation and the situations in which they interact are familiar.The plot is character driven; Rowling's understanding of people and her skill in presenting them will have readers empathising with her characters, even -- perhaps especially -- when they are not people who you would want as neighbours.The adult townsfolk are flawed human beings motivated by their desire to maintain (and possibly improve) their places within their exclusive little world.  Their machinations are counterpointed against the lives of teenagers from both the town and the tract housing close by who rebel against their parents, whose sexual and social transgressions make them easy targets for juvenile revenge.  Both the adults and teenagers derive pleasure from the misfortune of others, creating a dangerous mix of interlinked feuding that is reminiscent of some  British murder mysteries.It will come as no surprise to Rowling fans that the teenagers are especially convincing.  Unlike the characters of the Harry Potter novels, they have no magic, no idealised school with fascinating teachers who care for them, and no heroic destiny to save the world from an evil genius.  This is not the wondrous alternative world Rowling shaped out of medieval myths and magic.  Here is no Hogwarts with its profligate riot of marvellous beasts, larger than life characters and cheerful flaunting of natural law.  Instead, the characters in A Casual Vacancy have to cope with the everyday, gritty life in which Rowling herself lived until her imagination lifted her into well-deserved fame and fortune.People the world over love to revisit Harry's world where courage, hope and loyalty are bound to prevail.  Harry Potter has an indomitable spirit in the face of adversity, in part because of his parents' love. He is luckier than the characters in A Casual Vacancy.  The novel captures the way young people strive to overcome the consequences of their parents' stupidity, cupidity and selfishness in the deeply flawed society in which we all live.  Like Harry, they are bloodied but unbowed.",4,"07 11, 2013",1373500800,"[1, 2]"

Yes, I found it difficult to begin and to sustain through the first portion of the book. Yes, I found it immensely good after I got into it. I knew going into this novel it was not a children's book. I was also, for some reason, expecting a mystery type book (this isn't), and that, too was difficult to work through as I began to read the book on its own merit.  It is hard, though, to distance yourself from Rowling as Harry's creator and Rowling as the voice of Pagford. However, I really reminded myself that it was a different book with a different purpose and if I kept reading I would find something of merit. Was I ever right. I am amazed at Rowling's ability to distance herself from children's literature and write a very adult novel using very adult language and themes. It was a huge break from the past and one that took bravery and daring to write. I was also amazed at the development of the characters and the plot lines. Each character had a unique and distinct voice. I think what was difficult for me at first was keeping them all separate, however, once they are all introduced and you are moved between them and among them and introduced to each of them through the other characters, I was amazed at the intricacy with which it was written. As far as writer's craft goes, it is excellent. As the plot continues to unfold, Rowling continues to tie one person's observations and interpretations into another character's reality...and let me say...they are not always one and the same. Truly, things are not as they appear in Pagford, and the necessity of ""keeping up appearances"" hides a lot of pain and misery. No, it is not a happy book (although there are moments of lightheartedness and wit), but just because it is not happy and does not sugar coat reality does not make it any less compelling. It took me a long time to read it. I began in September when it came out and I just finished in mid-November. Mainly because the beginning was difficult for me to sustain. Once I determined I was going to go back to it, and got past all the introductions, it flew and I finished the remaining 2/3 in just a couple of days (my reading time is limited). If you are a Harry fan, please try to separate yourself from the other series. If you give the book a chance on its own merit, you may be surprised at how involved you become in empathizing with (or hating) some of the characters. I am convinced to go back and re-read the beginning, now that I am more in touch with the characters...I will enjoy it more the second time around. The 4 stars are because of the slow beginning.

The omniscient framework that let the reader into every character's head showed only the worst of each person: fear, pettiness, and selfishness, with the only pleasures coming from sticking a pin in someone else. The offscreen Barry Fairbrother was apparently the only decent person in town, although even he was a bit of a jerk in the first couple of pages before he died and created the casual vacancy.To my surprise, somewhere in the last 200 pages I found myself drawn in to the plot, caring about some of the characters, and interested in how the others ended up. It was as if over the course of the novel I first got to know each character only down to the shallow depth that a cynical teenager might see in an adult (phony surface with vanity and ignorance underneath), but ultimately I got to know them as actual human beings I could understand and even cry over.I have a feeling that if I reread the first 300 pages I would see the comic side, knowing the characters as I do now.

"0316228532","AR7NK1XK62ACD","Sho","Better than I anticipated","Does this sound about right? ""Rowling's refusal to conform to happy endings demonstrates the fact that The Casual Vacancy is not meant to be entertainment. She wants to deal with real-life issues, not the fantasy world to which women writers are often confined. Her ambition is to create a portrait of the complexity of ordinary human life: quiet tragedies, petty character failings, small triumphs, and quiet moments of dignity. The complexity of her portrait of provincial society is reflected in the complexity of individual characters. The contradictions in the character of the individual person are evident in the shifting sympathies of the reader. One moment, we pity Stuart, the next we judge him critically.""Actually, that's a summary of Eliot's Middlemarch with a few names and tenses changed (actual quote at SparkNotes dot com's website). Some online reviewers, especially those who read the free previews, have rated this book low on Amazon and elsewhere and stated that it was boring so they did not continue. These reviews may be translated as ""tl;dr"" comments. The readers might say the same of Middlemarch.Many of the early professional reviews also seem to me to miss the mark, perhaps because the reviewer had to read the book in a few hours with a phalanx of Little, Brown lawyers on hand. They seem to have skimmed for easy quotes and have missed much of the context that situates what they've plucked from the text. Like some of the the sample-only readers, they have not taken the very obvious cues of the novel's opening that it will build gradually. Unlike the Harry Potter series, this is not action/adventure, or even mystery.The Casual Vacancy indeed starts slowly. Because the novel at first presents itself as a comedy of manners, it's no surprise that Rowling takes some time to introduce the large cast of characters as they first react to Barry's death. While most people are initially socially appropriate (at least in public), the death inspires both noble and self-serving thoughts. Like the people of Pagford, the reader only discovers these aspirations and interpretations as the story and relationships unfold. The vacancy left by Barry turns out to be anything but casual.We see families interacting with their members and with other families. The genre gradually shifts to become more plot- and action-driven as thoughts become deeds, sometimes not for the better. The reader sees several slow train wrecks in the offing as events inexorably roll on.This is not a happy book, and it is not uplifting. Most of the characters are unlikable, though as their stories unfold, their complexity in some cases increases the reader's sympathy and identification. There is a great deal of swearing, shagging, smoking, and drug use (none of which would have been particularly shocking from another author). There are many mean, small-minded acts. Yet none of this is glamorized (most of it falls in the faintly absurd to somewhat gross spectrum), and it is matched by many characters' sad evaluations of their own relationships, longing to be closer to (or farther from) other people, agony over acne and hair, helplessness, and fear. People wish they had each others' families. Triangulation, insults, secrets, and violence occur behind closed doors. Rowling realistically depicts pettiness, teenage angst, teen and adult posturing, and the sometimes stifling and intrusive nature of small towns and their politics. It is like being at your social services job day and night. It is depressing. It is also very funny, though this is only occasionally presented in character's actions and is more frequently evident in surprising adjectives, comparisons, or characters' thoughts that veer from what is expected. There are, though, events that are deeply, wonderfully absurd, and all the more so for the earnestness and self-absorption with which they are enacted.Grief is a constant theme--grief for lost people and lost opportunities. Rage, both acute and simmering, appears time and again. The major actions catalyzed by Barry's death and its initial implications can be characterized as The Long Secret meets anti-Potter. What happens when teenagers take matters into their own hands? Generally speaking, the outcome is not good. Where Harry saves his world, the adolescents of Pagford destroy it. Most of the adults, who strive to assuage their inchoate longings with gossip, sexy boy bands, and reading posts by Barry's ghost, and who regularly misinterpret motives and are often wounded by each other, are no better or more mature. More complex than Harry Potter, this story ends without tidy wrap-ups, and more like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The ghost indeed exacts his due, though Jesus-like Barry might be horrified by this misuse of his legacy.Barry's saintliness probably would have showed more tarnish had he been alive and present through the book; he serves as a symbol of, among other things, the other characters' longing for a Jesus-like figure to hold their need for absolution. However, redemptions are few and far between, with the only unequivocal example being the river-dunking of Sukhvinder Jawanda.A few criticisms:Like the Harry Potter series, this is structured as a chiasmus. The reader who guesses or observes this may find the events of the end of the book too predictable.After the second incident, the third time a teen trashed an adult online seemed reductive and mechanical.While I'm not familiar with UK law, I will imagine that had Parminder Jawanda aided Howard during a medical emergency, she would have been in the clear. Why Kay would violate a client's confidentiality several times, with no consequences, I cannot say, but it seemed like an easy way for Rowling to share information without straightforward exposition.Exposition is one of Rowling's stylistic weaknesses in Harry Potter, and there was still much telling rather than showing here. However, The Casual Vacancy is an improvement. Characters have more interiority, and even though this sometimes has the feel of interior exposition (as when Fats ruminates over an ""authenticity"" most reminiscent of Sartre's Nausea), there is somewhat less told about the characters by an impersonal narrator. The shifts of perspective throughout the novel contribute immensely to Rowling's ability to give us characters in action rather than words about characters and pronouncements about their actions. In this regard, it's better than Harry Potter.",4,"09 29, 2012",1348876800,"[13, 16]"

Words flow in the book so eloquently and naturally that you're left astounded that they could be mixed up in such a brilliant manner.The Casual Vacancy soaks you completely in the many shades of human psyche and makes you empathize, dislike and laugh with or at them. The characters are developed beautifully, even posthumously, bringing in their uniqueness and personality to affect others and though the plot is more like a soap opera revealing itself in numerous episodes,through her words and great understanding of human character, she makes the tale less drama and more realistic. It's not the kind of book that hits you in one go but instead slowly makes it's way into your thoughts and your conscience and you're awed by the complexity of human nature- to help when you have nothing, to do nothing when you can, to give up on relations that have nothing wrong or to hold on to things you have to let go of or to fight powers that you do not understand or to make mistakes that are the only way to get rid off your problems- the book forces you to be slow to criticize and more open to believing that people have their reasons and their stories.A real development from the Harry potter feet, I salute her versatility and her ability to observe and narrate and proclaim myself to be an ardent follower through all her literary journeys.",4,"12 21, 2012",1356048000,"[1, 1]"

She doesn't narrate. She holds your hand, sometimes tight, so you can't run away (Thank you for that) and sometimes lightly, just to assure you you are still with her. That you are still walking with her, looking through her loving eyes (I can't believe I am saying that!) seeing inner and outer filth, greed, inauthenticity, anger, pretense, and learn, as she must have, to take it all in, and not refuse it out of hand, but hold it in your eyes long enough for self-recognition to hit.This ability, missing from most people, is the ticket to a great life.

The masses don't like books like this, because the masses like Heroes and Villains (note the capital H and capital V). Well, none of those here, though it could be argued that Obbo and Fats are villains (small v) and that Krystal Weedon is an antihero of sorts. But none of that clean and artificial character delineation we so often see in books. Some characters are thoroughly detestable (Shirley, I'm lookin' at you), and a lot of characters are deeply flawed (including the aforementioned Krystal), but what makes them interesting is that they ring true. The garden variety Good and Evil characters of other books are relentlessly artificial, and I find it difficult to engage with such characters. J. K. Rowling wasn't afraid to ditch that paradigm, even though she had perhaps been the biggest purveyor of them (thus my lack of interest in Harry Potter), and I applaud her for it.

"0316228532","A3UHS4GW81DEDR","Silicon Valley Girl","Just substitute sex & drugs for wizardry...","... and Bob's your uncle in J.K. Rowling's new universe.I really loved this book. It's true, there's no magic in it. Instead there's drug addiction, child abuse and neglect, and a variety of sexual misbehavior. But the voice is unmistakably J.K. Rowling's, and that woman sure knows how to tell a story.Just as the Harry Potter series fit into classic English genre -- two of them, actually, the boarding school novel and the fantasy novel -- ""The Casual Vacancy"" is written in the tradition of the English village novel, which encompasses writers from George Eliot and Anthony Trollope on through Joanna Trollope and Helen Simonson of ""Major Pettigrew's Last Stand."" And there's a little of ""Major Pettigrew"" in this novel -- which also features village prejudice against Britons of south Asian descent -- but the south Asians in question are a lot less saintly than Major Pettigrew's Mrs. Ali. No one in this book is a saint, in fact, with the possible exception of the character who dies in the first chapter, creating the casual vacancy of the title. Imagine a world where Harry Potter is killed halfway into the fight against Voldemort, and you've more or less got the set-up.So, yeah, every character in this book is deeply flawed, but few are outright villains. Everyone's life is more or less grim, but everyone also dreams of something better. The big question is whether they'll be able to do anything about it, for themselves or for others. Like the Harry Potter series, ""The Casual Vacancy"" is ultimately about life's big moral questions -- but it's written so entertainingly that you don't quite realize it till the end.I had a hard time putting this book down -- I read it over a weekend, and I would have finished much faster if it hadn't been a really busy weekend. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Eliot's ""Middlemarch,"" but without the boring parts. Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews; if you're a fan of big, chewy novels and you like Rowling's writing style, you won't be disappointed.ETA: I see that a lot of the one-star reviews come from folks who are shocked and dismayed that there is profanity in this book. Yes, people, this is a novel for adults. If seeing the F-word in print sends you straight to your fainting couch, you'll probably want to skip this one.",5,"10 8, 2012",1349654400,"[7, 10]"

"0316228532","A1LCFEI3LP1TVR","Simply Keith","Brilliant, Disturbing, Not for Everyone","Having read some of the more negative views, I have to say this:  Would you have ranked ""1984"", ""The Bluest Eye"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", or ""Great Expectations"" so badly? Guess what, some of the best stories aren't fun-filled light reading!  Some of the best works are disturbing, even sad. So, if your view of literature is that a book can only be worthwhile if you can breeze through it having a fun adventure, then don't bother with this book.  This is something else entirely.That said, ""The Casual Vacancy"" is a disturbing character study.  It is written in third-person omniscient point of view. It does require some effort to handle a story with some 18 or so viewpoint characters, so this book will be at too high a reading level for some. I normally don't like the omniscient POV, but this story had to be told that way and Rowling handles it with expertise.So, what is this book about?  It is about pain and cruelty and why people become cruel.  There are no traditional protagonists or antagonists, just people going through life.  Rowling explores the various ways that people become cruel, angry, or jaded with each main character showing a different form of cruelty and a different reason for it.  And, this book is about the people that get hurt by other people's pain and anger.This isn't an easy book to read, probably the reason so many have reviewed it negatively.  But, this is a brilliantly written book, just not for everyone.This novel is written with a seldom-seen narrative structure.  In this structure the story begins with a simple, perhaps commonplace, connection between a group of people (in this case, someone dies, which has some effect on each of these characters).  The narrative then explores how each character's life led him or her to be present for that connecting event and then the character moves on past the single event.  As this structure is used for a character study, the connecting event may not even be particularly important.  Instead, we see a collection of interconnected characters as the main thrust of the novel, rather than a single story unfolding.  In this case, we follow how the death at the beginning of the novel affects approximately 18 characters.I highly recommend this book to those who want to read something thought-provoking and actually about the real world.  But, if you want some light reading that you don't have to think about, then stay away from ""The Casual Vacancy"".To those who reviewed it negatively because it wasn't like Harry Potter, I can only ask whether they were paying attention.  Rowling explored many of these themes, hidden behind the window dressing of fantasy, in those books. That is why Harry Potter was not just another of the countless stories about magical children.  She continues this exploration in ""The Casual Vacancy"", but without the magic and without the restrictions of children's literature.Edited to add:  I realize that Rowling has described this as a dark comedy.  I don't know why she has said that.  Perhaps she had intended this to be a comedy, and there are some satirical scenes, but it grew into something else as she developed and revised it.  Whatever the case, I saw very little that was humorous in this book.  I did greatly appreciate the book, but I don't know why she would claim it was a comedy, dark or otherwise.",5,"10 8, 2012",1349654400,"[950, 1006]"
"0316228532","A19GJX6TTSK0C0","Sirius","I did not expect it to be Harry Potter","I loved Harry Potter books, I really did, but the last thing I expected from this book is to be anything like Harry Potter. I expected the book for adults which has nothing to do with magic and everything to do with reality of our existance. I expected something along the line of Dikkens, along the line of my beloved Russian classics of 19 century. Based on the reviews I expected something maybe not as well written, but with similar subject matter like Dostoevsky.I am writing all of this to stress that the reason I disliked this book so much has nothing to do with me expecting something fun, light and entertaining. I did not. I also want to stress that it is all me, it is not the book's fault.Yes, the people in this book have to deal with terrible things. You name it it is there - abuse, poverty, drug use, more abuse, just plain out marriages that not working. It is all there, so in that sense it reminded me of Dostoevsky a little. Do you know what's different? I hated them all. It is so true that the person that had something worthy in him as a person leaves the book within first few pages.I did not expect the perfect people in this book, heck I would have been fine with wrecks of human existance, grey, almost dark characters. But I did not feel that one of them has a spark, something redeemable in him? Gogol, Dickens, Dostoevsky wrote a lot about horrible, miserable people, but they managed to make me feel for their characters, made me pity them. Those humans? I would not mind if they all would drop dead now. I pretty much could not stand most of them.For some reason when I read this book, I was also thinking of american TV show The Wire. Those who watched it may confirm that this show dealt with some of the darkest horrors of human nature and looked at those horrors very unflinchingly. But guess what? The worst criminal sometimes showed that they still had a little tiny something in them to remind us that they are humans. Not so much in this book as far as I am concerned.I deeply respect that this is the book JKR wanted to write and I think for what she wanted to convey, she wrote it remarkably well (thus three stars and not one out of respect for writing), but boy I despised her subjects and if this is the story she would continue telling in her next books, I do not care to continue reading them.",3,"01 1, 2013",1356998400,"[1, 2]"

It is one that is firmly centred around the book's characters.The death of Barry Fairbrother, a councillor in a small town, unravels the lives of people that he came into contact with. The impact of Barry's death on individuals within the community that he was part of is told in a 'warts and all' style.The story cleverly shows how everyday lives within a community can be so intertwined, without the people realising. Everyone has their place, their routine, their status, and everyone has their own spin on things around them. Normally, these opinions and beliefs lie hidden under the surface of happy daily life.Barry's death opens this can of worms. Family turmoil, personal demons, lingering prejudices and different opinions bubble to the surface, as townsfolk scramble to win his vacated seat on the council. To succeed, would provide them with the power to set things in place that are in line with their own preferences.There were definitely plenty of cringe-worthy moments in this book, some of which I didn't really enjoy. But, the fact that they triggered such a strong reaction from me is evidence of clever writing. The foul language was plentiful, and although it was there to show the essence of the seedier characters, I felt there was too much (maybe I'm getting old and prudish!).In my opinion, the last fifty pages in the book were the best, but I have to add that all the pages before were completely necessary to build the overall story. I'm trying hard not to include any spoilers in this review. I can say that I was engrossed in the story, it's characters and messages ... and I was truly affected by the outcome.J.K. has swung this book to be as opposite to Harry Potter as she could.

I was NOT expecting it to be anything like Harry Potter - phenomena of that sort come around once in a lifetime and I was curious to see how JK Rowling would be as a writer when she wasn't writing about HP.I was pleasantly surprised in this book.  It's 180 degrees from HP and accurately captured a bit of time in an English village.  I thought the character development was wonderful - you get the public persona of the characters first and then the layers of the onion start peeling away and you get the true self of the person.  The premise of the story is a character that dies in the first pages of the book and leaves an opening on the city council in the village and how the remaining council members go about filling his position and the politics (for lack of a better word) of it.  It's also about how the teenagers in the story, extract their revenge (?), on the parents and adults that stifle them.  It's a good mix of an &#34;us vs. them&#34; and Rowling weaves the two story lines together very, very well.The book did start off a bit slowly and was actually kind of boring... but just as slowly, the layers began peeling back and the story deepened.  In a way, it reminded of me &#34;Revolutionary Road&#34; by Richard Yates.  You're reading along, thinking maybe you'll put the book down (and possibly never pick it back up) and that undefinable moment occurs and you realize that you're halfway through the book and completely hooked on the story.I will admit, this book did not capture me the way the HP series did, nor did I expect it to.  I also enjoyed &#34;The Cuckoo's Calling&#34; more than I enjoyed 'The Casual Vacancy&#34;, but I think it's because the story line in &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; was so raw and so true to life that also makes it a more difficult read.  Who can't imagine a teenaged girl, with a drug addicted mother, desperate to escape her life.  Or another girl, bullied by her over-achieving parents that cuts herself to relieve the pain?  Or the cuckolded housewife that makes her husband pay in the end?  Or the bored housewife who longs for a more exciting life?

There was always going to be huge pressure on JK Rowling to deliver the goods with her book after Harry Potter and I believe she has.The book opens with the death of a councilman of Pagford and proceeds to detail the events leading up to the election of a new councilperson. Making the events more interesting are the contentious issues surrounding the election and the consequences which will be felt depending on the standpoint of the newly elected councilperson. These issues include whether the much maligned Fields may remain part of Pagford and the closing of the addiction clinic. Interwoven into this are the personal stories of a myriad of characters, some of which are sympathetic and others which are somewhat loathsome. I found the plot engaging and incredibly interesting and I must commend the author for weaving together a cohesive tale with so many diverse characters and plots.

There are certainly some like that in this book, and Rowling uses them to paint a portrait of small town life in England that is alternately funny and appalling.  There's the self-satisfied and self-important parish council chairman whose chief goal in life is to cut off from his village a local housing project and de-fund the social services that help its struggling residents.  There's the middle-aged woman, trapped in a loveless, boring marriage, who secretly obsesses over a member of a boy band she sees in her daughter's DVD collection.  There's the middle manager at a printing company who terrorizes his wife and kids as though they were inmates in a concentration camp of which he is the commandant.  But there are also several characters who are well-meaning and want to do good works that don't benefit them personally - except in terms of validating their self-image.None of the characters in the book are people you'd want as friends or neighbors.

"0316228532","AHCUFJHJAD6HP","S. McKinney","A hot mess worth zero stars (spoiler alert)","I was interested in reading what JKR had to say as an adult novelist - my kids grew up along with Harry Potter, and although I loved those books, I thought that a writer of her prodigious talent would probably be able to pull off a non-Potter adult novel with ease.I was so wrong. Dear God, was I wrong.The novel began with a sharp step off the curb and never regained its footing, staggering on through hundreds of pages of misery, not just for the characters in the book, but also for the eager reader, whose enthusiasm hit rock bottom at about page 100. I only persevered because my mama taught me not to be a quitter.It's hard to know where to begin, but it's probably best to start with the many, many characters (the plot doesn't matter - it was as dull as a bowl of oatmeal), not a single one of whom is admirable or even slightly likeable. It's not just that they're flawed, because who wants to read a book about perfect, adorable people who always do and say perfect, adorable things? (If that's the sort of novel you like to read, I'd like to point you toward Jan Karon's gooey Mitford series.) No, this novel doesn't have one single sympathetic character: You pretty much hate them all from first to last. The only way to distinguish among them is that some are worse than others. It's as if Rowling said, ""I want to write an adult novel with adult themes, so how's about I throw in some pedophilia? AND some mental illness? AND a rapist? AND a sadistic, revolting teenager or two? AND some adultery? AND a crack whore? AND a self-mutilator? AND an abusive husband/father? AND wives who are hatefully contemptuous of their husbands? AND some husbands who act more like children than men? AND about a thousand f-bombs? AND some ugly sex? AND...AND...AND...""Do you get my point? This dystopian novel contains barely a shred of kindness, mercy, selflessness, family solidarity or, I don't know, LOVE. Everyone is locked into miserable relationships, everyone is suffering, everyone is mean, everyone is selfish. This was probably the most depressing book I've ever read and if Rowling thought the sad, anti-climactic ending there at the church with the pink coffin and the little, tiny white coffin in any way shone the light of redemption on the previous four hundred and some pages, she was sadly mistaken. This book was horrible. After a while, it went from being disturbing to just being ludicrous; does any novel have a larger cast of characters, none of whom have any depth other than loathsomeness of one kind or another? It's one of those novels that I wouldn't even want to donate to Goodwill - why would I want to inflict this awful story on anyone else?Oh, for one multi-faceted Severus Snape, with his venomous tongue and his doe Patronus! Oh, for a many-layered Dumbledore with his upright heart and his murky past! Why do the kids get all the fabulously-drawn characters with their wrongs and their rights, their petty hatreds and their monumental graces, and we adults get landed with a novel full of nothing but Dursleys?This novel was a major disappointment. My recommendation, if you feel you absolutely must read it, is to borrow it from your public library. Do not spend the money on this one.Edited to add: My continuing thought on this book is that Joanne Rowling definitely has a voice as a writer, it's just that, with this novel as an example, I don't think her voice is one for adults. Maybe her true niche is writing outstanding young adult fiction - heaven knows the world could use more solid writing in that genre, and there's certainly no shame in writing books that entertain, instruct and enlighten the YA crowd, which is exactly what she did with the Potter series. I am hoping that The Casual Vacancy is just an aberration, a hiccup in her career, because this book doesn't even seem like *her.* JK Rowling is an author who knows how to flawlessly develop a character. She's brilliant at it. She's better than this book, SO much better. The second piece of advice I have to add to this review is that if you haven't read the Harry Potter series, go do it right now and see what this talented woman is truly capable of. Read Harry Potter with your adult sensibilities, not just allowing the plot line engross you, but also to observe the manner in which the imperfect characters grow into grace with their strengths, weaknesses, failures and triumphs. It should be an able antidote if you read The Casual Vacancy.",1,"09 30, 2012",1348963200,"[855, 1028]"

One thing that is consistent is JK Rowling's beautiful writing, ability to weave a complex story and insight into human nature.  Unlike Harry, The Casual Vacancy is about as close to reality as one could hope in a work of fiction.  Be ready, this book has swearing, sex and ugliness, but not without purpose.  Superficially, the book is about the vacuum left in the townspeople's lives when a relatively young town councillor suddenly dies.  More profoundly, the book is about how people affect one another, sometimes for good, sometimes for bad.  Many of the scenes are painfully sad because they are so honest.  But I did not find this book entirely depressing.  I found it inspiring in that it made me appreciate the good in my life, reaffirming how important it is for each one of us to notice one another and try to care as best we can.As for complaints that there are too many characters, there are many great books with a lot of characters.  Give the book some time, and you'll eventually remember exactly who everyone is and want to know where their story is going (and how they are connected).I really hope Rowling writes more books and isn't put out by the negative reviews readers have had of this one.

I was just so happy to finally be reading a book written by JK Rowling again. I realized in reading this book that I love her writing style. She does such an excellent job at developing the characters and the story in very subtle ways. There were a lot of characters, and I found myself getting a little confused at the beginning, but that is not unusual. It happens with a lot of books, especially the really good ones. The book draws you in and gets you invested in these characters, despite the fact that none of them are very likable. That was actually what I found most surprising about this book. You have this cast of characters that all are either terrible people or woefully flawed, and you still are rooting for them and want to keep reading to see what is going to happen. I didn't want the book to end. It's one of those books that could just keep going and going, since it's not really about very much to begin with.

I loved the Harry Potter series and was aware this book as going to be very different from what I've come to expect from J.K. Rowling.This book did take me a bit to get into but the character development and details of the locations and their lives transport you into their worlds.  Even though I wasn't able to really feel attached to any of the characters since most of them were so self absorbed and uncaring; J.K. Rowling has a fantastic way of describing people and places so you can visualize what she's writing and trying to get across to the reader.  Her ability to do that is fantastic but with this book it turns out to be kind of disturbing and pretty sad.

If you're expecting a happy ending, don't count on it because it isn't there.

It is heavy on character development, which many seem to decry...the Amazon reviews lament that and lack of plot. Well..in my humble opinion too few authors develop their characters, and she does a smashing job here :-) had to sound a tad British. You will recognize many of the characters in your families, friends, neighbors; I cared deeply for many, loathed quite a few, and feared for others. At one point, when you see what is going to happen, you will be shouting through the pages for characters to see what is right in front of them..as you would in a horror movie when someone is about to go off alone etc. Point of view is expressed beautifully...along with it denial, rationalization, and justification. She is depicting life, and despite it hitting close to home, and perhaps not the escape some Amazon readers want, I truly admire her writing for so, so many reasons. Yeah, a traditional plot line would be hard to summarize here...but if you can't stand the cardboard characters in so many novels you come across, pick this up, and read it.Keep in mind that one of the reasons Harry Potter was so wonderful, was her ability to develop the characters, engaging her readers so intensely, that we longed for more.

One star may seem a little harsh, but truth be told, I am just mostly frustrated. It took me about a month to get through this book, when I usually breeze through them, and the only reason I couldn't is because J.K. Rowling gave me nothing to look forward to.I will start out by pointing out the positives in this book: it is VERY WELL written. No one can deny that Rowling can write, and no one can fault her skill. She is an incredible writer. But I am not here to mark her on her writing, and unfortunately, everything else about the book for me (beyond the writing) just fell short.A lot of the 4 and 5 star reviews said that Rowling has a right to change the genre of her books and this is what adult books are like and to stop comparing it with Harry Potter, but worst of all, that the characterization was so good that they were drawn in and could not put the book down.The book started out interestingly enough, with what might have been the only interesting character in the whole book! In fact, Barry Fairbrother was the only one with any redeeming qualities, or so it seemed. Yet, his appearance was short-lived - literally - and we are left with this enormous mess that he left behind and with the collection of horrendous characters that live in this town. It's really hard to read a book when you can't like or root for any character, especially surprising with the amount of characters in this book. None of them were the least bit likable, and no, I'm not looking for a perfect Hollywoodified set of characters. If I wanted to read a book about perfect people, who live perfect lives where it all wraps up very nicely and everything ends happily, I'd have opted for a chicklit. But you can't even begin to feel sorry for them, you just hate them.One reviewer put it best by saying, ""It's as if Rowling said, 'I want to write an adult novel with adult themes, so how's about I throw in some pedophilia? AND some mental illness? AND a rapist? AND a sadistic, revolting teenager or two? AND some adultery? AND a crack whore? AND a self-mutilator? AND an abusive husband/father? AND wives who are hatefully contemptuous of their husbands? AND some husbands who act more like children than men? AND about a thousand f-bombs? AND some ugly sex? AND...AND...AND...'""Some reviewers implied that we should be commending Rowling for this book the way we would Orwell for 1984. Um, seriously? I'm all for great literary novels that discuss serious themes and absolutely shred our society to pieces such as A Clockwork Orange and  Lord of the Flies, but this book was not framed in that sense, and it definitely did not read that way either. This book takes about eighteen or so characters, places them in a boring little town, kills an important member of their council and then we watch them as they all fight with each other on who gets this vacant seat, while little inner family dramas occur on the sidelines. I really would not place this book up there with the likes of 1984. There was nothing clever about it, nothing creative, and nothing ingenious. It is a boring story, a tale as old as time, told again and again and again. Yes, Rowling is an incredible writer, but this story with its plot and characters and so on, was just not good enough to be categorized with the brilliant books mentioned above.I appreciate stories that are realistic and reflect societies in their true form, but this really had no redeeming qualities, not a shred of hope, and the last few pages (Part 7 that is), might have been her idea of reforming the characters and erasing the 400+ pages that just happened, but they really don't. If it was an interesting story, I would have forgiven all of that, but it was just dull. It was just one of those things where I lost interest because it was taking too long for me to get through this book.I'll leave you with what one reviewer so eloquently said: ""Oh, for one multi-faceted Severus Snape, with his venomous tongue and his doe Patronus!

I guess that's what the author, J.K. Rowling, is telling her audience.The various levels of economy present problems significant to each group. Rowling's writing makes us feel this. For example, the poor have problems with their basic needs being met. Not only is food in short supply, but drug use and a means of acquiring the drugs rob them of human dignity.Those who have more comfortable life styles have their set of problems too. The typical keeping up with friends and neighbors leads to dishonesty and conflict. Both material entities and everyday dealings with social life in the neighborhood and town are involved. Again, Rowling masterfully sees to it that we see it.Teenagers are a part of all these levels with their own problems, wants, needs, desires, etc.Much offensive language is used throughout the story.

The book is told over a set of 15 CD's and I loaded them into my vehicle's CD player five at a time.  At the end of the fifth CD I contemplated tossing the whole thing in the garbage, but my desire to find out what happens to Krystal and Robbie Weedon forced me to soldier on.The problem is, this book is seriously depressing. Every character is mean spirited and quite frankly, just awful!  Those who should know better, who are well off financially and better educated, seem to just enjoy being self indulgent and nasty, and characters like Krystal and her mother Terri, who live in abject poverty, are kept down by one disappointment after another.  Regardless, they are all such horrible people as to be completely unsympathetic.Rowling's use of the English language is at times pretentious, she uses words that one would rarely find in everyday conversation, much less among a small English villages' students and small business owners. Rather than finding the language eloquent I found it pompous.  But what I found most disappointing was the ending, which completely fell apart.

"0316228532","A2Z9L0JK0XRS61","S. Spilka","A Rousseaistic Quandary","I must confess that when I was reading the book, I wanted to write a review that would bury it. Like many others, I felt that the adult characters in the book were intolerably mean, cruel, and selfish. However, now that I have finished the book, I am propelled to praise it. Simply put, I miss it. Unbelievably, I want to be in Pagford again, with its unsavory characters and heart-breaking victims. Why? Because the book is vivid and powerful, and its ending packs a punch.But there is more. Each portrayal of the nasty adult characters is limned with his of her anguish; they are cruel or stupid, but they are also suffering. Thus they become more complex characters that many reviewers thought them to be. Of course, some of them do not earn any of our sympathies, but many do, in their disappointments and loneliness. The view of Pagford is dismal, but it is bound to arouse not only our indignation, but also our compassionate reflection.So many reviews have already been written on this book that I knew I'd have to present a new insight, or point of view. So I went back to the 18th-century French philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who put forth the belief in childhood innocence, threatened by corrupt adult society. Rousseau's views influenced 19th century writers--Dickens, Mark Twain, Lewis Carroll, and many others. Even Dostoevsky often entertained the Rousseaistic belief in childhood innocence, but he was more ambivalent about it. Before I go back to Dostoevsky, here's the Rousseaistic quandary: if only children are innocent, and the  adults are unworthy, what do we do? We must grow up! Must we inevitably fall into the corrupt net the grown-ups before us have set for us? Is there no other direction--for growth and redemption--for the adults? That's the question that Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, in its entirety, poses for us. And the ultimate answer is no, the adults are also capable of growth.In the chapter ""Rebellion,"" preceding his famous fable, ""The Grand Inquisitor,"" Ivan asserts that only children are innocent. Children can be loved, he says, ""even when they are ugly (I fancy, though, children are never ugly)."" Adults, on the other hand, are ""disgusting"" and ""unworthy of love."" He further says, ""the devil take them all.""And yet, Dostoyevsky himself doesn't agree. Dmitri Karamazov, Ivan's brother, swears up and down that he is going to kill his father. As he says to his brother Alyosha: ""I can stop it or carry it through...Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through...I shall carry out my base plan...Darkness and destruction!"" But Dmitri doesn't carry it through! He does not kill his father! He triumphs over his most destructive impulses and is even ready to renounce Grushenka to her rightful fiance,  a Polish guy who had all but disappeared from the scene. So Dmitri gets his punishment for wishing to kill his father, and he also gets his lover, Grushenka, now a fitting mate (rather than an object of obsessive lust). Dmitri has grown and earned his moral freedom.My only problem with The Casual Vacancy is that I couldn't find adults to identify with. Unike Rousseau, Rowling doesn't present the young characters as innocent, but, like Rousseau, she puts her faith in them; they are the only ones capable of growth, heroism, and even a measure of contrition and nobility. Where are the grown-ups who are capable of growth and introspection? They are nowhere to be found!If Rowling wants to go back to Pagford, I have a suggestion for her: create adult characters who are capable of growth and change, who have consciences, and who are not so selfish and distracted.  Perhaps adults who are in love, or who love their children, because those adults do exist (for example, you do). Now that you have taken out all the anger on the adults, perhaps it is time to find their redemptive possibilities.",5,"10 12, 2012",1350000000,"[2, 3]"

I actually read aloud several sections of the book to co-workers because the writing was so good. Every word was perfect and it was a joy to read. Now with that said, about 100 pages in I thought I would need to draw out family trees to keep all of the characters straight both as to who they were and how they fit into the larger story. As I continued reading, I figured it all out and actually thought that if I were a newcomer to Pagford that is exactly how I would have felt anyway.I thought the fact that the smallest storylines continued throughout -- the computer in the stream causing injury comes to mind -- was excellent and brought some humor to the more tension filled sections of the book. The characters are so well developed, and even though I could easily identify many of the characteristics in people I know, they did not come across as canned or cardboard like.With all of that said, if you cannot stomach foul language or are looking for an adult version of Harry Potter then you probably won't enjoy this book.

"0316228532","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","Stanley Crowe","you'll laugh, you'll cry, you won't put it down . . .BUT . . .","Strengths: The multiple plots are very deftly interwoven, and there are elements of suspense in each and elements of suspense throughout that make you want to keep reading. The writing is clear and straightforward, not particularly elegant, but it doesn't get in the way.Problems: Think of the multiple plot-lines as making up a web -- everything is connected, but there isn't a clear shape to the whole thing. You can break down the individual lines and find some shape -- and that helps you keep reading -- but where's the shape to the whole? There are many generational conflicts and familial tensions, but it's hard to see anything emerging as a kind of thematic center out of the varieties of these. In a sense, there's too much going on, perhaps, to be drawn together. The canonical writer who does this kind of thing better is Dickens, but one could say that in ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" for example, you just have to go with a not-very-well-centered mass of plot elements just as you do here, and, one could argue, these are melodramatic within the conventions of Dickens's time in a way that Rowling's plots are melodramatic -- like the stories on reality TV -- by the conventions of ours. ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is compulsively readable, and to Rowling's credit, her book is too. It's long, and I couldn't put it down. But there are novels by Dickens like ""Bleak House"" and ""Little Dorrit"" where the variety of invention coexists with clear central themes that pull things together. Let's see if in later novels Rowling can bring that degree of coherence to diverse material. ""Harry Potter"" -- all six volumes of it -- suggests that she maybe could, but she hasn't done it yet. Her later novel, ""The Cuckoo's Calling,"" is a fine mystery procedural, but that's a less ambitious genre.One could perhaps argue that ""The Casual Vacancy"" and ""Nicholas Nickleby"" share a great theme: innocence in danger. The trouble is that it's hard to see Rowling's innocents (with the exception of Robbie, perhaps) as really innocent. Most of the young characters are damaged and unattractive to start with. And there isn't a central malevolent force who emerges -- like Ralph Nickleby -- as a focus for the forces that threaten innocence. Too many of Rowling's characters are dangers to themselves and others for such a focus to be clear. The closest thing to a central sinister figure is himself a teenager, Stuart ""Fats"" Wall -- but he's not, in his destructiveness and unhappiness, sufficiently different from the other damaged children to really fill that central role. For a sinister adult figure, there's Howard Mollison -- but the effects of his machinations do not obviously fall on the younger characters. As for the causes of the unhappiness of the younger characters, one can point to shortcomings of the parents, but the book doesn't really allow you to generalize about that -- they're screwed up in so many different ways. And oddly (or ironically), the children who suffer the trauma of parental death seem to be quite well adjusted throughout.The author has to know everything, but he or she doesn't have to TELL everything. Space needs to be left for the reader's engagement through inferential interpretation. It's a weakness of the novel, I think, that Rowling's narrator is in EVERYBODY'S head. The characters are all explained; their inner thoughts are laid bare. There is nothing mysterious or fascinating about them. One could argue that the sheer number of the characters whose interwoven stories she is telling requires Rowling to be explicit to the point of over-explicitness in order to keep the reader from getting confused by the sheer number of characters about whom inferences would have to be made (and remembered) with a less heavy narrator presence. Maybe . . . . but I still worry about the sheer amount to information conveyed so bluntly.For all that, there are vividly realized scenes nonetheless, often embarrassed social encounters, that Rowling brings off well. And some readers don't mind being told rather than shown. With all that, and the impressive plot-line weaving, this is a highly readable book. It's a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion: you can't look away from these overwrought, melodramatic figures.",3,"12 3, 2013",1386028800,"[1, 1]"

Having now completed this book, I have to say that it was very well written and fundamentally interesting.  However, it is a bit of a downer overall with just a little redemption in the final pages.I would not want to re-invest time in reading another Rowling book that is of this genre.

No, I haven't read HP.)","Throwing in my two cents as one of the few people on the planet who hasn't read the HP series. (My kids were the perfect age as the books came out: young enough to love them, old enough to read for themselves.) I pre-ordered THE CASUAL VACANCY and inhaled it the minute it hit my Kindle mainly (I will admit) because it's a remarkable moment of publishing history, but I was quickly drawn into the story. The characters are people I already know, because they are the people we all already know. In the end, I liked this book on its own merits. And I liked it a lot.Rowling is a terrifically strong writer; you can't fault her on craft, and I like that she doesn't feel the need to do any acrobatics or post a billboard - THIS WAY TO THE BRILLIANT WRITER - on every page, as is the irritating case in a lot of literary fiction. If you're able to set aside the JK ROWLING of it all, you'll love or hate this book on the strength of what it says about people. Folks. Relationships that are the opposite of magic. Politics that are petty. The youthful compulsion to crusade - at any age - and the crusty compulsion to squash the crusading of others.Early on, it's noted that Samantha ""enjoyed [Miles'] pomposity with precisely the same spirit as she liked, on formal occasions, to wear a hat,"" and Rowling is able to enjoy the faults of these characters the same way. These are the characters Franzen would write if he had more tenderness and less literary dyspepsia. Observations about resonant, everyday dynamics - conversational currency, backhanded charity, the lie of self-sacrifice - are made with more wry than sly and not a whiff of self-righteousness.This is a quiet book; some will say cozy, but I think there's enough edge to prevent that. I loved the dry Britcom humor. A thousand little understated zingers make THE CASUAL VACANCY a pleasure to read in the way that theMapp and Luciabooks are a pleasure. As life unravels for the people of Pagford, we have a goldfish bowl view, but that understated tone keeps things from going totally soapy.A book that kept coming back to me as I read was Joseph Heller'sSomething Happened.

That determination came from the name on the front cover. I am extremely disappointed in my lack of praise of this novel for I had been enthusiastic about it leading up to its release. The main problem was that with the introduction of so many characters it took a long time to become engulfed in the story (perhaps a map of all the characters at the beginning or end may have helped). The use of overt sexual references felt pretentious, like Rowling was trying to distance herself intentionally from her previous audience without adding much to the story. Like Rowling is so good at, she wound the web between the characters brilliantly, but her need to prove that she is not a &#8220;one-trick-pony&#8221; backfired. One of my biggest disappointments is that she wasted time working on this novel when she could have brought us another classic from the world of Harry Potter. I wasn't looking for Magic in the novel, but I was expecting the Magical way in which Rowling writes.

As in I almost put it down. But the thought of shunning Rowling like that made me a little sad (I mean come on, the woman created the single greatest wizard series that ever existed - where was that magic hiding??), so I powered through. And then about 150 pages in (which is really quite a lot of pages to struggle through), something clicked and I really started to enjoy myself.I think the initial problem lay in the fact that Rowling is an amazing character developer. Problem, you say? You're crazy! You see, Rowling specializes in having a larger than usual number of central characters, whose personalities and relationships are expertly concocted. In Harry Potter (I'm sorry to keep referencing it and will stop after this - just bare with me) there were dozens of central characters, who, beyond just their personality traits, were made memorable by their names. I mean come on - nobody is going to mix up Mundungus Fletcher with Hermione or Crookshanks with Hagrid. The names are unusual and therefore tend to stick in the old noggin a little better. In The Casual Vacancy, there were still around 20 main characters, but with names like Harold and Andrew, Ruth and Maureen, I tended to get everyone confused. Hence, I needed the 150 pages to finally get everyone's backstories straight so I could start understanding what the heck was actually going on.As my confusion over the characters ebbed a tad, I was able to fully appreciate Rowling's talents. Each character fit perfectly into the story with a robust character and realistic flaws. The plot wasn't particularly earth-shattering - it served as a non-distracting vehicle to further develop the characters and their relationships. The story line was quite dark at times, proving that Rowling can stretch well beyond the realm of young adult fiction.Sooooo long story short - it's a good book.

The best correlative story for comparison is the film Crash.  It follows many different characters in a small town who are generally pretty nasty to each other, or have other motives besides friendship, and in the end, maybe they have changed slightly as a result of what happened, but we're not sure.My conclusion is that while not a bad story, I would not recommend it unless you have absolutely nothing better to read.

Or, you know, like Lindsay Lohan or Britney Spears. Or, prior to them, Drew Barrymore (if any of you remember when she went through that stage and posed in Playboy and all of that). It's not that there is sex in the book, it's that any time there was anything sexual, she conveyed it in the most crude and vulgar way possible. Like the detailed description of a young girl's genital area in a quasi-sexual way. It just seemed to me like a cry of, &#34;Look! I can write adult stuff! I can!&#34;Aside from that issue, though, it's quite an interesting read. At least it is for a while. Well, it's interesting like a traffic accident is interesting. I mean, none of the characters are what you would call &#34;good.&#34; So here is the spoiler warning before I go on.The most interesting thing about the book is that the only &#34;good&#34; character, the protagonist, dies. No, not somewhere along the way; he dies right at the beginning. That's the inciting incident. And, no, he doesn't come back to life nor is he a ghost or anything like that. He's just dead. The rest of the book is about this election because of his vacated council seat and, along the way, we find out how he influenced his community. We find out just how good he was, which shows us all the failings of the people around him as they are set up against the person he was. I suppose the effect is like taking over a new job and having to listen to everyone go on and on about how great the previous person was. You form a picture of that person (distorted, sure) without ever meeting him.On the other side of that, none of the other characters are really likable, so there's no driving force to keep reading. You're just not rooting for anyone. So, although the book is really well written and interesting in the way it's put together, it's really hard to feel any empathy for any of the characters. As soon as you start to think, &#34;well, this one's okay,&#34; that one will do something horrible to someone and it becomes, &#34;well, never mind, then.&#34; I suppose the closest we get to a character we want to see make it is Krystal Weedon, but that's only because Fairbrother (the dead guy) wanted to see her make it. You do feel sorry for her from time to time, but she's also not a very nice person, with reason, so it's difficult to retain that bond with her.There are two main failings of the book. The first is perspective. It's third person omniscient, but it's kind of all over the place. There are a lot of characters, so there is a lot of shifting perspectives, which isn't really the problem. The problem is that Rowling has no pattern she follows for this. Sometimes, she takes the characters by section by section so that there is a clear change in character perspective. However, sometimes, it's like being at a party with a video camera and the perspective changes as you walk around and film different people. One paragraph you're with one person and the next, because someone more interesting walked past, you're following someone new around. If Rowling had used just one of those formats, it would have been okay, but switching back and forth made it a bit muddled. Still, if this had been the only issue, it would have been fine.The other issue is the one that makes the book not really work for me in the end. Even though Fairbrother is dead, he serves as the main character for more than 75% of the book. Near the end, though, it's like Rowling decided that she just needed to end the story (which she did), and events quit revolving or being related to the death of Fairbrother. (And double spoiler alert!) It is not, however, because events gradually diverge; that could have worked. Instead, she just starts killing people. Everyone comes into a personal crisis all on the same day, and she resolves the crisis of the book not by resolving the crisis of the book but by delivering arbitrary death upon characters. It was just... unsatisfying. It wasn't even death in a Shakespearean sense where everyone kills each other. There just needed to be resolution, and that's how she did it. I suppose there's not a better way to bring a character's story to an end. Unless you start with that character's death, I guess.So... great writing on the micro-level. The characters were well-developed and fascinating, just not likable. But the perspective changes and failure at the end made the book just not work for me overall. Few of the characters really learn anything or have any character growth; it just ends. I suppose that's because the death of the one character we're supposed to want to make it, the thing that would have made Fairbrother's life mean something, brought Fairbrother's story to a close. But nothing felt finished even though there was nothing more to say.I suppose that's real life, but, although I want realism, I don't read a story for real life. I want a story arc, not just a bunch of stuff that happened to some people.",3,"02 5, 2014",1391558400,"[2, 3]"

"0316228532","A3306R2G4LHEJV","Summerroll ""summerroll""","Worthwhile, Truthful Portrayal of Humanity","This novel suffers from comparison to the Harry Potter series, only because HP succeeded on such a stratospheric level.  HP had the advantage of a slow crescendo, the patient accumulation of characters and plot lines, the unique relationship of author to readers that saw growth of the characters parallel to real time.A cursory comparison may show The Casual Vacancy to be distinctly different from HP.  Rowling has attempted to play with the edgier elements of literature, incorporating mature themes and language.  However, a deeper look shows that Rowling's preoccupations remain steadfast.  There are themes of childhood abandonment, the importance and responsibility of adult stewardship, the strength of unconditional love, personal defense through humor and intelligence.  Despite the actions and thoughts of many mean, despicable characters, she shows her catholic belief in human goodness.  Rowling, a classics scholar, knows her Sophocles.  Tragedy, uncourted but unavoidable, redeems heroes.Rowling is a master of ensemble action.  Here, a large cast of characters from upper middle to lower class, populating the small fictitious English town of Pagford, interact with several intersecting plot lines.  Barry Fairbrother, a member of the town council, unexpectedly dies of a brain aneurysm on the way to his anniversary dinner.  His death creates a ""casual vacancy"" on the town council, prompting competing interests to fill the position.  Rowling explores these competing interests throughout the novel.  A drug addicted mother and her two children live in public housing.  A Sikh Indian doctor, unhappy with her marriage and job, uses her position on the council to set social ills aright, and to confront her own unhappiness.  An abusive husband and father gets his comeuppance.  A noncommittal solicitor feels the results of his non-action.  A school counsellor with OCD is faced with real tragedy at home.  A wealthy grocery store owner and his supercilious bourgeois wife confront their own dishonesties.The strongest character in the book is a teenager named Krystal Wheedon.  Krystal is the 16-year-old daughter of a drug-addicted mother, Terri Wheedon.  They live in public housing, with Krystal's 3-year-old brother Robbie.  Terri's drug addiction and desperate life are poorly managed by the social service agencies, which largely fail the children.  The one adult who understood and believed in Krystal's capacity to succeed was Barry Fairbrother.  He had recruited her to row on a championship crew team in high school, but the team dissolved on his death.  Rowling's depiction of Krystal is sympathetic and true.  She is a complex character, motivated to seek love and kinship (with her absent half-siblings, her unknown father, her school counsellors, her dying great-grandmother), and to protect her brother and mother.In the book, one character (Fats Wall) acts despicably and dishonorably in the name of ""authenticity.""  Rowling asks the reader to ponder the meaning of authenticity: does authenticity lie in action or in motivation?  Does authenticity mean unreflective action, regardless of consequence?  Does authenticity trump kindness---the kindness of white lies?Fats is the kind of immature character, like Draco Malfoy, who goes through a transformation that causes him to question his deepest beliefs.  Even when he was at his most unsympathetic, I had a feeling that Rowling was holding a trump card to save a second chance for him (like she did for Draco).  Rowling's sympathy toward misdirected kids, or maybe just kids who feel lost in an adult world, is clear.  I got the feeling that she was a lost child herself---a self-made child who survived.I also felt that the deepest sympathy for Krystal is because she is a victim of circumstances beyond her control.  Through it all, Krystal remains authentic.  She does not pursue authenticity as an outward armor or a facade, as Fats does, but possesses the authenticity of the desperate, and remains true even though she has the most to lose.I agree with the description of the book as a ""dark comedy,"" the way that Oscar Wilde's plays or ""All's Well that Ends Well"" are comedies.  There are unsavory characters and motivations.  Fate deals its hand remorselessly.  Yet it is an entertaining and finely crafted story, a social satire, a multifaceted puzzle.  Rowling is not an extraordinary stylist, nor did she ever claim to be.  She is, like Charles Dickens, a humanist who happens to be a gifted novelist.  She has much to offer, and I await happily.",4,"05 19, 2013",1368921600,"[2, 2]"

When council member Barry Fairbrother unexpectedly dies, several residents decide to run for his seat so they can advocate for or agaist the Fields.  This leads to a series of events where family secrets are revealed and tragedies unfold.First, the good news.  J.K Rowling has an amazing way of bringing characters to life.  This is one of those novels that's more about the characters than the plot. Her descriptions of the angst, the insecurities, the bullying, the helplessness in the face of abusive parents, and the thought processes of teens is spot on. Her description of a school counselor reminded me of many teachers I've known.  The description of the busybody wife of a local council member rang so true.Now the bad news.  This book is grim, unrelentingly grim.  Almost every character (and there are many) is unhappy and deeply flawed.  Fathers are mentally and physically abusive to their children.  Husbands cheat on their wives.  Employees steal from their bosses.  Teens bully other teens.  Mothers are drug addicts and prostitutes.  Marriages are unhappy. Teens take revenge on their parents.  There's rape.  There's death.  It goes on and on.Throughout the first half of the book I kept asking myself why I was reading this.  It was all so depressing  Then one of the characters set something in motion that made me want to keep reading.  The second half moved along at a faster clip than the first half.

The plot is every bit as intricate and twisted as any of the Harry Potter books, the characters are fully drawn and believable, and the action keeps you in suspense, waiting for the multiple threads of narrative that Rowling lays out to align and spontaneously combust. You can feel that explosion coming early in the book, as layer after layer of the peaceful veneer of small-town life in the English countryside is peeled away to reveal the simmering cauldron of anxieties, neuroses, overblown egos, class and racial tensions, and suppressed rage that lies beneath.This is most definitely a novel for adults, with sex, drug abuse, profanity, rape, suicide, and difficult adult situations replacing the wands, brooms, creatures, and spells of the Potter series, but I suspect that there is much here for the 18 to 20-somethings who grew up on Potter to dig into. Much of the action revolves around and is driven by several teenagers coming to terms with adult feelings and adult responsibilities while struggling to deal with adults in their lives who are at their mildest somewhat whacky and at their worst very dangerous.

I kept seeing Casual Vacancy at the bookstore and had read and heard good reviews of the novel so I gave it a whirl. The book starts out with the death of a council member, Barry Fairbrother, from a small town called Pagford in England. His death affects the entire town where he lives in both positive and negative ways. It's hard to keep all of the townspeople straight in your mind for the first few chapters, but once you delve further into the book it's fascinating to see the chain reaction Barry's death has as it impacts more and more people's lives. Harry Potter fans be warned that there are some VERY adult themes in this book, it's NOT a children's/teen's book by any stretch of the imagination and it quite morbid at times. That being said, I enjoyed reading Casual Vacancy because all of the characters were so well formed that you felt you had a real understanding of who they are and could sympathize with the struggles they go through (even if they are totally foreign to the struggles you have in your own daily life).

I'm an avid reader and certainly don't expect my novels to be nothing but sweetness and light, but this book is utterly unpleasant. It's a character-driven novel, but none of the characters are likeable or admirable in the least. This is not a story of good people fighting bad people; it's a story of disgusting, self-centered people interacting with other disgusting, self-centered people. The story jumps so rapidly from one character's POV to another's, I didn't feel invested in any of them; didn't know them; didn't care about them. I actually had to write notes to remember names -- who was whose son, wife, enemy, etc. There is very little plot; no causes or quests I cared about.

I was ready to plow through the unpleasantness out of loyalty to Rowling, but realized around page 120 that, not only was I repulsed by these people, I was bored out of my mind.

Rowling is determined to prove that she can write an ""adult"" book, even though the ""Harry Potter"" series seemed to appeal to grownups just as much as it did to children. There's a ridiculous amount of cursing, talk of sex, masturbation, menstruation, drug use and more, and seemingly every single character has nothing but horrible things to say about every other character. I honestly understand why some readers were put off; it's not shocking as much as it's crude and unnecessary.Also - and this is probably the novel's biggest flaw - Rowling does a horrible job differentiating between the three dozen plus characters. Even towards the end, I still had to pause every now and then and try to remember who Maureen or Ruth was and how they were connected to the other characters. It's not that she doesn't create three-dimensional characters, it's just that she creates so many of them and rarely references anything about them beyond their names when beginning new sections that it's easy to get confused.But after a while, the story finds its rhythm. Although certain characters continue to curse throughout the novel, it's indicative of their upbringing and environment as opposed to the author's wish to write a ""mature"" novel. Bit by bit, Rowling fleshes out her characters, and while few of them are angels, most of them do end up being far more well-rounded and sympathetic than they first appeared to be.What eventually makes this such an entertaining novel is the realization that it's basically a soap opera set in a small town, one that wants to deal with everything from class wars and racial prejudice to the hypocrisy of liberals and the narrow-minded pettiness of conservatives, but a soap opera that does it in a way that never feels too preachy or contrived. And, of course, there are constant scandals and betrayals, leading up to a fascinating if convoluted climax that more than triumphantly nails the finish.If this had been written by someone else, I'm not sure if I would have gone much past the first third of the book. Much of the beginning feels clumsy and not well-thought-out, and I'm still not sure why Rowling felt the need to open with dozens and dozens of characters. On the other hand, there was something about the story and the writing that piqued my interest enough that I might have kept reading even if it had been written by someone else.But what matters in the final analysis is whether or not I enjoyed the book. And I can definitely say this book built momentum throughout and ended in an explosive, page-flipping finale that made it all worthwhile. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in small-town politics and scandals, although I would also suggest patience to let the author and the story find its stride, because once it does, it really is a hugely entertaining ride.",4,"05 25, 2013",1369440000,"[1, 1]"

At first, it's a bit confusing who is who - it's like you've dropped into the middle of the story. But then, as the story unfolds, everything becomes clear little by little. It definitely has a very adult story-line and there's quite a bit of foul language used by the 'lower classes' (more as a tool to show the class differences than for gratuitous cursing, I think).Overall, this is not ""Harry Potter"" for sure, but rather a very adult story with interesting characters and a fascinating story that is teased out over the course of the book. The writing is very good, with some very clever bits of description and wit, and great characters. Well worth reading - looking forward to more in this vein as well.",4,"11 12, 2012",1352678400,"[1, 1]"

Of course he must be replaced as quickly as possible as not to disrupt governance.  In the ensuing days the citizens of the village show their true colors and reveal their allegiance to one &#34;side&#34; or another.  They also show their class-conscieniouness and pettishness.  To add to the mess, the neighboring village is lower-middle-class whom the uppity citizens may look down upon.  The lower class village does provide crime, drug use and addiction, and vulgar behavior.  Of course there is overlap between between the villages.  &#34;The Casual vacancy&#34; is somewhat enlightening as to the workings of the British class system.

This is a very tragic tale that shows how everyone fights some sort of daily battle in their lives, whether against bullies, fear, addiction, loneliness, or society itself.The parts I wasn't fond of:There's a large cast of characters (no main character) which made it a bit hard to keep everyone straight, especially early on. I also felt like the story got off to a very slow start in which the pace didn't pick up until after the midway point.The parts I enjoyed:The last fifth or so of the book best showcases Rowling's writing, as numerous tragic events hit all at once.  I found myself unable to put it down when I came to this point, since I had to know what was happening to certain characters.  There were several twists that added to the plot, things I definitely didn't see coming.

"0316228532","A12T42FYUZ3KC","TK McEachin","J.K. Rowling Fails This Time Around, but I'm Still Rooting for Her","To start, this is my blog before I read a significant portion of the novel:""It's no secret to those who know me that I am not a huge fan of the Harry Potter novels. I have all of them except the last two on my shelf but couldn't/didn't read past Book II. Since so many hailed the novels as children's books that adults can enjoy too, I decided to give them a read years ago,because I love the fantasy genre so much. Then later after the first couple of movies I decided to watch the first, I fell asleep. That was the end of my effort to try and like Harry Potter. Needless to say, if the novels encourage reading in children, that alone is reason enough to throw some admiration JK Rowling's way. So yesterday, JK Rowling enters the adult fiction genre with her latest book, The Casual Vacancy. I am going to read it so I can write a review and since I was never a fan of the Harry Potter books, I might actually like this one, we'll see. After reading all of the ""professional critics"" reviews I must agree with a person who criticized the critics in the comments section of a blog saying:""These reviewers have just made themselves look stupid. I imagine a 10-year-old HP fan would would have a similar reaction. ""Where is Harry? What about Dumbledore?"" They are professional critics who should be reviewing the book for what it is, not what it isn't.""Some of the reviews include:""And forget trying to find a character resembling Harry or Hermione."" --Henry Sutton, the Mirror""It's that the characters in The Casual Vacancy feel so much less fully imagined than the ones in the Harry Potter epic."" --Michiko Kakutani, the New YorkTimes""Harry Potter fans may long for a few more unicorns, though."" --David Sexton, the Evening Standard(I'm mentally adding in many of the Amazon reader reviews as well because many of the 1-star reviews were due to the pricing and/or by people that didn't read one sentence of the novel, which is not fair, especially when there's a sample available for free. Those comments (I won't dare call them reviews) are for chat forums not the review section)I may not have liked the Harry Potter books that I read (or movies I attempted to watch) but at least I have the sense enough to start reading it knowing full well that it's not a children's book & that it is in no any way related to Harry Potter. Surely, the famed, erudite book critics of the New York Times, LA Times or  New York Daily News received the memo that The Casual Vacancy  was not Harry Potter Book VIII, right? What were these reviewers thinking?  Many of the reviews are simply unfair. This book has to be read with a fresh set of unbiased, non- Harry Potter spectacles and evaluated on it's own merits. If the writing is dull or characters under/over developed fine, but references to the Harry Potter world are ludicrous. I can completely understand those who simply don't like this book, for reasons unrelated to the Harry Potter series, but when I see reviews replete with statements about hogwarts, magic & wizards it's more than disappointing from a professional reviewer. You just can't compare The Casual Vacancy to Harry Potter because there is no comparison. Last I checked...that's called comparing apples & oranges. Now obviously, this is not the case for every review, but many of them have this bias. I'm going to read this new adult novel from J.K. Rowling, but you better believe, that if I don't like it, it will be simply because it's not a good book, not because a lingering nostalgia & appetite left over from Harry Potter needs to be fed. Ijs...""Now that I've read some of this novel, I can state that based on it's own merits, I don't like it at all. It's dystopian plot/setting is not the problem but rather her ability to keep our attention w/o graphic sex, pedophilia...etc. I don't have a problem with such topics but when the writing is poor, inclusion of such things screams ""excuse my bad writing, but the story is good/has shocking elements"".I didn't make it through the entire book (and I read fast) because it just was not worthy of my time but I read enough). The characters are underdeveloped, the dialogue is boring, there's too much profanity (for my taste)& some of the figurative language is weak (Sliced his head like a demolition ball"") - Really J.K.???. There's not enough sentence structure diversity (many sentences start off with ""Barry said....Barry____...(for example) - she needed to change it up some, sorry. The only reason that I didn't give it only one star is because I can think of books that are worse. I'm not going to say that she should go back to children's fantasy as some have suggested, because there are a lot of famous authors who simply have that one (or more) bad book (and that's somewhat arrogant, could any of those reviewers have written this book better?), but most certainly a course on writing fiction for adults would be my recommendation to her. Hey, as a writer myself (soon to be published)I know that no matter how many books one sells or how famous a writer becomes, you never stop learning. The day you think you know it all is the day that you fail. Now, I'm not saying that's her attitude by any means, but writing for adults is different from writing for children and I'm just not sure she understands that. Adults/Young Adults are just as concerned about the writing as they are the story/creativity. I applaud her effort & tackling a new genre for adults & hopefully the next adult novel will be better. As for me, I won't abandon J.K. Rowling altogether but I hope the writing is better the next time around & not mediocre yet successful in sales because of her name's staying power. Hope this is helpful.[...]",2,"09 29, 2012",1348876800,"[9, 20]"

"0316228532","A1KHYYTQKR6KUL","TMS","Likely would not have been published if she weren't J.K. Rowling","Whew! Managed to slog my way through that!  I wouldn't recommend this book.  The first 100 or so pages, in particular, are just interminable.  Nothing is happening except the introduction of characters - ALL of whom are boring and annoyingly dysfunctional.  Also, the author is trying way too hard to prove that she can write an adult novel.  Unfortunately, her definition of ""adult"" seems to be simply crude and/or profane.  Things do pick up a tiny bit after that, but, in general, the book is simply tiring, ponderous and depressing.The real problem is the characters.  It took me awhile, but I finally figured out what was wrong with them.  In the Harry Potter books (and yes, yes, I understand completely that they can't be compared), Rowling displayed her talent for writing a good action story.  The characters, though, were not deep or complex.  There were basically the good guys and the bad guys.  (And, of course, since HP was written for young adults, the adolescents are all smarter than the grown-ups.)  In this book, there is essentially no action.  What little plot there is, is unrealistic - in particular the whole computer hacking scenario. This is a book entirely about the ""character"" of the characters and, sad to say, there is no depth or complexity here either.  Every single character is one-dimensional -- he or she is simply his or her dysfunction, and it's horrid.  500 pages of unrealistic, unlikeable people who basically do....nothing.One other oddity that English teachers would have a field day with is how much of this story is told parenthetically - usually background stories, but generally with no reason for it to be written that way.  It got so that whenever I saw an opening parenthesis I would stop reading and look to see how far away the closing paren was.  At first it was just a paragraph or two, but later some of these parenthetical remarks ran two or more pages!I saw J.K. Rowling interviewed just before the book came out.  She stated that she simply did not have the time of day for, and could not speak to, anyone who did not cry at the end of this book.  To which I say, what pure, unadulterated arrogance.

Like the Potter books, each paragraph is filled with details, word play and dark humor--there is no skimming (which is my usual M.O., but I didn't want to here).  But here there are no wizards to entertain, only a mundane village at a particularly un-mundane moment.  With chips on their shoulders and such a trivial subject as everyday people, this rich density is, I suspect, why so many people couldn't get into it.Had any number of British authors written this book, it would have been praised.  Don't be mistaken, it is very British; again, no wizards are about to bridge the gap for Americans.  It is clever, and I found myself wanting to read it whenever I was doing something else.

These themes are not over done or tacky, but it takes a bit to get over Fairbrother's death and how it impacts each character as well as the council. I was sucked in by the 4th or 5th chapter, but had I read this when I was 30 I probably would have set it aside. That being said this is a story of codependency, drugs, methadone, teenagers attempting to find themselves and adults that have lost themselves, as well as their values and morals having been twisted by obligation and the silly useless things we tell ourselves we HAVE to do. It is also a story of how they find their way back.Yes, there are teenagers having sex and about 5 pages of a mad mans ramblings about what IF he was party to pedophilia and the suggestion of it later, but I have to applaud writers who write about reality and not silly trumped up fantasies. There are also some really angry wives, deluded characters, and of course the old hens of the town who do nothing but gossip.I really appreciated Rowling's use of vocabulary and language in this novel.

You might think that you are completely singular and alone with your thoughts in this world, but it's a safe bet that one of your neighbors is having the exact same thoughts.I'm so disappointed that this book is being judged so heavily as not being what people expected (read: not Harry Potter). It's an adult book dealing with the real world and cruel, horrible and uncomfortable situations. I'd say more than anything this is a character study. Can marriage that looks destined for failure endure? Just HOW happy is that perfect couple? And the most heartwrenching: Can that crass, rude girl from a drug addled broken home ever be anything more? Sometimes the answers are exactly as you'd expect and sometimes characters will surprise you.If I can take away anything from this story it's that none of us exist in our own world.

"0316228532","A31DPTQFIRG4ZS","turnerpage ""turnerpage""","A  Novel for Our Time","The Casual Vacancy, J.K. Rowling's first novel for adults is set in the fictional town of Pagford, an area where the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' grows ever wider with each passing day.  The Casual Vacancy of the title is the job advertisement for the election of a new parish councillor, after the death of the much-admired Barry Fairbrother, who keels over in the opening pages of the book.  Fairbrother, a working class hero, who never forgot about those less fortunate than himself, is one of the few characters in the ensemble cast, that you can really warm to.The local Parish Council are planning to vote on whether or not to cast off their troublesome dodgy housing estate, with its drug problems and welfare dependent occupants.  Barry was one of the few councillors to support The Fields, but one of those vying for his vacant seat, Miles Mollison, has different ideas and has chosen to stand, not for altruistic reasons but to keep the riff-raff out.As well as Barry's devastated family, there is one other character, Krystal Weedon, who has been very badly affected by his death.  Barry seemed to be the only person in Pagford who saw potential in Krystal. He encouraged her to join the rowing team, which was the only thing in her life that she had done for herself. Krystal reminds me of Vicky Pollard of Little Britain fame, although there is nothing remotely funny about the way Krystal lives.Decisions being made in the UK right now around housing are being made at local government level and something that once seemed irrelevant and dull, suddenly takes on great importance when local government officials have the power to okay or veto large scale housing developments in what were once quiet rural communities. I too have sat through 'interminable, ill-humoured council meetings,' where decisions are taken that could have a profound effect on the local community.The town of Pagford is a microcosm of British life. Many of the characters reflect the current attitudes, which have hardened in recent years, polarising society into 'skivers' versus 'strivers'.  Tabloid newspapers make much of the rising cost of the welfare budget but you don't need to be an economist to work out that in a recession (caused by the banking crisis and not the poor) that those struggling to get on the jobs ladder and the over 50s, who have been made redundant and replaced by cheaper, younger workers, are having to resort to state handouts.  It is hardly a life of luxury, despite the relentless tabloid headlines of examples of feckless welfare-dependents and their deviant behaviour.Most of the 'haves' in The Casual Vacancy come across as unpleasant, small-minded and in some cases downright vindictive.  Samantha Mollison, wife of Miles, describes him thus: 'Samantha sometimes found Miles absurd and, increasingly, dull. Every now and then, though, she enjoyed his pomposity in precisely the same spirit as she liked, on formal occasions, to wear a hat.'  Then there is this apt metaphor for rural Middle England life:  'Miles, Samantha thought, was looking back at his father like a big fat Labrador, quivering in expectation of a treat.'If Miles is a Labrador, then Simon Price is an aggressive, menacing, guard dog.  He terrorises his family, not just with threats but with physical violence. He is particularly cruel to his wife: 'Simon was seized with a brutal urge to punish her for intuiting his own fears and for stoking them with her anxiety.'The characters on the Left seem to be afforded more sympathy than those on the Right but even well-meaning social worker Kay comes across as someone who sees her clients as a series of case notes and problems rather than as human beings.  Kay is regarded with contempt by both her daughter, who blames her mother for ruining her life by uprooting her from the excitement of Hackney, and her ungrateful boyfriend, Gavin.  Kay, who made the move to Pagford to spend more time with Gavin, is callously cast aside when she tries to take their relationship further than the occasional night in together. Gavin, who can't wait to be rid of her, reflects on their relationship, thus: 'there had been Kay; clinging to him like an aggressive and threatening barnacle.'There is no doubt that J.K Rowling has written a novel for our time, in the way that Dickens and Trollope did in the Victorian era.  Many other writers have had a stab at writing the state-of-the-nation novel, including Jonathan Frantzen, writing about middle class life in the US. Where Rowling soars above her peers, is her depiction of the lives of those at the bottom of the heap, in this case, the Weedons. It is at times heartbreaking to read about Robbie's neglect and his sister, Krystal's modest aspirations to have her own house, so that she can take Robbie off their drug addicted mother's hands and try to give him a life.  Perhaps the subtitle of The Casual Vacancy should have been Hard Times because whether you agree with the politics or not, life is only going to become harder for those, like Krystal and Robbie, who for whatever reason, cannot help themselves.",5,"04 13, 2013",1365811200,"[1, 2]"

I was an avid Harry Potter fan as a child and was reticent to read something by Rowling what was not related to the books I had loved so dearly but I am glad I did. I think it was a brutally honest book about the world that people think that they live and the realities that they refuse to accept because it may not be what they had pictured their life looking like. It does have a heavy amount of swearing and sexual references, but then again it is written for adults and not young adults so let's hope people can handle it.

I found it difficult to put the book down after that though.  I thought Ms. Rowling did an excellent job portraying the many characters in her story.

Rowling, an enormously gifted author, who has clearly proven that &#34;Harry Potter&#34; does not contain the sum of her talents. &#34;Vacancy&#34; is an extremely well-crafted book, and contains many beautifully written and even moving passages. Its commentary on society, through the tragic character of Krystal Weedon, is poignant and well-rendered. At the same time, the book ends at its most hopeless point, with several of its characters' story arcs &#8212; not to mention, the central conflict of the entire novel &#8212; basically unresolved.The sex and swearing also felt gratuitous at times. And though the author explores a number of substantial issues, I repeatedly got the sense that J.K. Rowling's primary goal was to write a book that was as different from &#34;Harry Potter&#34; as she possibly could. Which is a fine exercise, and she does indeed demonstrate her tremendous range in this piece. But it still feels a little cheap when a reader gets the sense that the main reason a passage contains so much profanity is because the author wanted to show that she knows how to use the F-word.",3,"07 10, 2014",1404950400,"[0, 0]"

The novel that can be compared to a similar social situation was Jeffery Archer's Prison Diaries. I have read the first one and am half way through the second. They are really nice. He does not gloss over the conditions in the prison or even in some of cases that he shares with his audience. But the grace and the tact and the finesse that goes into the book is fantastic. They are classy in the understatement and descriptions. Not using words for the sake of titillating, but used to make the story come alive.Finally, I had to read my Harry Potter once again... and I cannot believe that the same person wrote this bilge...Please Ms. Rowling...

"0316228532","A3QJM0RNUXQ3WV","Valerie Jones","Dark, unexpected, and vivid","In the small English town of Pagford, everyone knows everyone else's business and privacy is a luxury. When Barry Fairbrother unexpectedly dies, the town is left with much unanticipated circumstances. A casual vacancy, as it is known on the town's Parish Council.  The town has been going through a long term political struggle over who is responsible for the costs of supporting the poverty stricken area, the Fields. Fairbrother was an ally of those who wanted to maintain support for the Fields, and with his death, the two opposing sides square off. The politics of the Parish Council only set the stage for the book. The turmoil is the stage for the real story about the variety of people who call the town home and their daily struggle in life.When the isolated town's main source of gossip, the Parish Council message board begins to receive anonymous posting revealing some of the characters deepest and darkest personal secrets, a town already struggling with the death of one of their biggest personalities must reconcile their own places in Pagford.  There are a multitude of characters in this book and at times it is hard to follow, but through the course of the book their diverse personalities, personal hardships, familial loyalty, and relationships are explored. What follows is a well told story that reaches the underbelly of society and the dark truth of its residents. Abuse, drugs, rape, teenage hormones, and sexual affairs are some of the few topics explored in the interwoven stories of the characters.This book was a struggle for me to start and I am still undecided about the end. The book really seems to not have a point to the plot, other than an exploration into the lives of the town's residents, but I cannot declare that I did or did not enjoy the book. Overall I am still undecided, and I think readers will also be torn. If you are seeking another Harry Potter phenomenon, you will be highly disappointed. This is a book for adults and the topics inappropriate for young adults and children.baseballvalbooks.wordpress.com",3,"10 29, 2012",1351468800,"[0, 0]"

After finishing the novel, I think, I know why  there are so many. I think, people expected JKR to come up with something as original as Harry Potter series.  Alas, Harry Potter happens only once, and we all are thankful that it did happen :-))This novel is gloomy to the point of being depressing. As much as I tried I did not see any trace of ""dry British humor"", as one review mentioned. Well, try to write about modern high school, and I don't think anything cheerful can come out of it. Little town with big ambitions, some openly dysfunctional families with substance abuse or physical abuse; some middle class families, which on the facade seem successful and loving, in reality - every family is unhappy in their own way (c) and there are a couple of skeletons in every closet. Three generations - grandparents, parents and teenagers. Lost communication between teenagers and parents. Domination of grandparents. Sandwich generation parents are drifting away from each other.Where is the line that you draw in helping others? What about your own family, how much time and efforts go into the closest people to you? Can you do more for your kids before you go and fight for less fortunate ones? And as much as you empathize with less fortunate kids and understand that this is not their fault they behave the way they do - are you ready and wiling to have them in your daughters' class?The first one hundred pages I found a bit slow, but as you make mental connections and start following all the characters, it is very addicting. In my opinion it can be less graphic in some parts and have less references to body part, sex, etc. - but that's just my opinion.Overall - good writing, real characters, makes you think about your values as a parent and about your family.Update - about two months after I read the book. I decided to change the review, after my friend asked me if I recommend the book for her to read. And my first impulse was - No, I do not.

I agree with the two ""most helpful review"" authors of the 4* and 5* reviews. The book is excellently crafted, and the characters are compelling. JK Rowling is a masterful writer. She takes a toxic brew of plus/minus 20 important characters, puts them in the pressure cooker of a small town in England's southwest (money and conservative politics), and turns up the heat. It's not a happy book, and pretty much all the characters are flawed. The heat and pressure bring out the worst.Some will fault the book on its elaborate physical descriptions of the characters and feel that the book could be shorter than 500 pages, but Rowling is painting a tightly focused and detailed picture with words. She needs the space to develop the photo.Others may find the characters too numerous and become frustrates because sometimes characters are called by their ""familiar"" names in addition to their first or last names. I found it useful to draw a character map to keep people straight until I got to know them better.There is lots of detail under the detail. For example, a less important character is Jolly (who isn't jolly). It's a mocking name that the family calls the daughter Suhkvinder, the rather slow and physically awkward daughter. Her mother berates her as lazy, and her father writes her off as someone not going to college. Jolly is dyslexic, and certainly bright enough (the reader will see she's no slouch), but neither her parents (physicians) nor the school's deputy headmaster or his guidance counselor wife do anything to assist her educational handicap. Jolly's parents are also oblivious as to how Jolly is ridiculed because of her facial hair which, according to reliable sources, is not uncommon in people of Indian descent.Clearly, the book is not for everyone, and you can see that by its numerical review scale.",5,"07 31, 2013",1375228800,"[0, 0]"

Lord","Into the minds of the petty Pagfordians","Ever the astute purveyor of internal dialogue, The Casual Vacancy takes us on a dark journey into the petty minds of citizens of Pagford, a small town in the west of the U.K.  Whereas Harry Potter's story highlighted every brave, kind, loyal impulse of man and took us on a journey of self-sacrifice and victory over evil, The Constant Vacancy does the opposite.  I found it depressing, and the heavy voiced narration of  Tom Hollander in the Audio CD version didn't help.  Everything was tinged with a dark undertone; there seemed to be no hope in sight for any of the characters.  I found I did not like any of the characters enough to care what ultimately happened to them, and I am even seriously reconsidering my desire to retire to just such a small place as Pagford, some idyllic place in the countryside of the U.K. now seeming to be a horrible grouping of nasty minded, petty individuals I'd do well to avoid.The writing itself was, as usual, stunning.  No one turns a phrase like J.K. Rowling.  I could see the characters in my mind's eye so clearly, and see the village as well.  It's kind of creepy to think that the author calmly looks at people and knows their inner, vile thoughts so well.  Knowing she herself has been in different class levels throughout her life, I'm sure she's met these characters along the way.I listened to the audio CD on my way to and from work to about 60% through, then skipped to the last CD and was able to gather what happened, plot wise.  This isn't a plot heavy story, it's mostly a character study.  I had to skip ahead because the darkness of it had started to affect my actual mood in a way I wasn't liking.  Do I recommend it?

But I probably won't be reading this one over and over. It had so many characters, all unlikable, that it took a long time to get into it.  Many of my favorite books have a setting or characters I'd like to revisit.  I didn't find the ""darkly comic"" element of this book funny enough to compensate for the fact of nearly all the characters being desperate, whiny, involved in sordid behavior and endlessly thwarted.  I kept wondering what was the author's point in writing this book, since it couldn't be to tell an enjoyable story.  And the horrible details of poverty, drug addiction and various kinds of abuse are all too familiar to anybody who reads the news.  In the last 10% of the book the plot finally started to move along, and some of the characters at the end did get to grow and change.  **SPOILER ALERT**--when certain characters died tragically I was actually relieved, as they had no future and were doomed from the start by the circumstances of their lives (and also the circumstances of the book--it was hard to see how they could sink much lower and this wasn't the type of book where they were going to get a happy ending).  One of these characters was the most sympathetic in the book and only in the last few pages were some anecdotes revealed that added to her humanity.  By the end I thought the author's point was probably to draw attention to the ways in which society fails its most disadvantaged children, and that in an interdependent world this has repercussions for people from other socioeconomic levels.  She accomplished this pretty well but it wasn't new territory, and not the book I was hoping for.My 12-year-old daughter and all her friends were planning to read this book.  I expressly told my daughter no (the first time I've ever forbidden her to read anything) and I hope the others don't either.  I understand that J.K. Rowling feels she has the freedom as an author to write whatever she needs to.  But this book, or what they could understand of it, would be very disturbing to kids that age, and it's a fact of life that some of them are going to go looking for it because they are Rowling fans.",3,"10 1, 2012",1349049600,"[6, 9]"

Rowling has written here one of my favorite type of stories: loads of characters seemingly disconnected, yet their stories come together in intricate ways.  Some reviewers aren't comfortable with the many characters whose moral codes are in the grey area at best, but I think that's what makes this a great novel.  Rowling has weaved together delicious drama and interpersonal conflict in her first adult novel, and I will continue to read anything she publishes!During the first 80 pages, I did find it difficult to organize the many characters into a working knowledge of Pagford's citizens, but eventually all comes together.  I found myself rooting for a particular character one moment, and wishing malice on them the next.  I love that Rowling put together plenty of emotional conflict with each character and left us to sort out our individual issues with them.This novel is heartbreaking while at the same time having plenty of love to share.

Other cranky Americans will gripe about minivans called  ""people carriers""  and high school called  ""fifth and sixth forms""  and the like.  Anyway the Council Head  (that's a city councilman for you testy Americans)  drops dead and the political wranglings and personal struggles of many residents makes for a British Miniseries novel.Rowling proves that she is not just a great storyteller (Harry Potter)  she is truly a great writer.  I like her style,  especially the paragraph-long musing asides that are placed in parenthesis.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that we needed to have a main protagonist early in the story.  She brings out loads of characters and the desires of each in quick vignettes.  I would have liked it a bit more if I had a good person I could identify with central to the story.  There are many characters here,  most with selfish and prurient interests.  It makes a good story, but I needed an angelic Elizabeth Bennett to interact with the sinners in order to get grounded.

You could have read a hundred novels with adult language, but seeing a couple of swear words from JK Rowling will definitely be shocking at first! You must get over all this if you want to enjoy the book.The Bad: The story starts out with a spiral of characters and setups. It doesn't slow down either, you are bombarded with characters, their descriptions, and small stories of their past. What makes it difficult to keep up is that every couple of pages or so, you are moved to a totally different setup with a bunch of new characters. This could have been fine if it wasn't as frequent. It gets very confusing and you almost want to give up because you feel like you're at 30% and still don't have a clue who this is or what's going on. You mustn't!The Good: It's really amazing, and quite fun seeing how all this chaos gets sorted out and related to each other slowly towards the end. After you endured the first half, you really get along with the characters even though they're not very lovable but you start to understand them better and would really want to go on. I just liked how the plot was tangled and then brilliantly cleared out. The way every small event and action made sense in the overall shaping of each character and their decision becomes very clear, it all makes sense!Overall, I gave it 3 stars because it's not exactly annoying to read, but then again it's not the greatest there is out there either.

The book is a bit hard to follow, however, because of the large number of characters and frequent switches in perspective.The action begins with the sudden death of a popular town council member, which sends shock waves throughout the community and will change the lives of many in the community.  Who will be the new member on the council, to fill &#8220;the casual vacancy&#8221;? What effect will there be on the troubled relationship between the little town of Pagford and an adjacent municipality of larger size and lower status.  Will the nursing care center stay open or be forced to close?The cast of characters includes children, teenagers, young adults, and older adults of both sexes, most of whom are seriously flawed human beings.  The marriages are troubled, there is a lot tension between local residents and outsiders, and the teens are in rebellion against their parents.Rowling is a master at delving into human motivation and the complexity of relationships.  I particularly enjoyed a pivotal chapter about a dinner party, narrated from the standpoints of several of the participants, which went off the rails and ended in a way that nobody expected.Some of the action is quite disturbing, there is a lot of vulgar language, and the overall impression is depressing &#8211; reaching a very low point with two or three chapters to go.

The conflict over Mr. Fairbrother's council seat reveals the deep division between the inhabitants of this idyllic town.  The war that erupts from this division is the focus of this heart-rending, sometimes comedic, sometimes violent novel.As is true with Ms. Rowling's previous novels, the character development drives this work.  The only innocents are those who are helpless to defend themselves; everyone else mentioned in the book contributes to the pain they suffer, to the havoc presently hovering over Pagford and refuses to change their behavior until it is too late to be redemptive.  In creating a wide range of characters and causing each of them to ""live,"" Ms. Rowling made a place for each reader to see their own ""dark side"" somewhere in the pages of this read.  The choices for those we meet in this book are three fold: 1) do what is easy, 2) do what is right or 3) get all you can when you can regardless of the cost to others.  Repeatedly, most of the characters are on the verge of making the ""right"" choice.  There are moments when there is hope that someone will choose ""to do what is right,"" but the person who could have made that choice and stuck to it apparently died in the book's opening pages.  Crystal's vulnerability and self-defeating plans, Fats' seeking for authenticity at the expense of everyone but himself, Howard's likes to believe that desire to ""better"" his family lies at his quest for power, Samantha's self-loathing is the result of her refusal to act from her own best ""place"" and Robbie's heart-breaking presence are only part of the actions that speak of the conflict within every choice and action taken.This is NOT a book for children, nor is it a book that would hold the attention of the typical contemporary adolescent.  It was not intended to be such.  The book pulls back the curtain on ""polite"" society to reveal what can be (is) held in the heart of humanity and confronts all with the real possibility that we all could be have despicably given the right occasion. The language spoken by most of those met in this community would have placed the students of Hogwarts on permanent detention.  There is sex and drug use described and the violence is of the kind that leaves bruises that may never heal through-out the body of this work.Because of the number of characters who have a role in this story, it took a while for me to get hooked by the story.  Once all the characters were known, I was enthralled quickly.  The people of Pagford, ""The Fields"" and Yarvil were those of quick acquaintance but enduring impression.  I found myself in tears at the close of the book due to equal parts of sadness at having to say goodbye to this town and of hope that the events that occurred in the few months I was allowed to visit had cause a true change in its people.Like Steven King's Castle Rock or William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, maybe Pagford will be Ms. Rowling's ""home base"" for MANY future stories.  I would like to visit it again.",4,"01 26, 2013",1359158400,"[3, 3]"

I also appreciate her effort to talk about difficult social issues we face today.Having said that, I have to admit the first 60% of The Casual Vacancy is just dull. I can see her efforts, but her writing style cannot deliver what she wants to tell us. Her characters are mostly two-dimensional and as a result, none of them are interesting enough for us to care. Because she made her characters just caricatures.You just don't feel they are real people.The story picks up the speed in the end, but I still couldn't care about any of the characters.",3,"09 29, 2012",1348876800,"[12, 16]"

There's definitely no real plot to speak of, it's just a very interesting character study of how vile & petty people can be.

"0316228532","AFZNJHDGE0DUJ","Zadius Sky","Not Intended for Children","Recently, I have read this latest book by J. K. Rowling whose ""Harry Potter"" works were absorbed by everyone a world over. ""A Casual Vacancy"" is profoundly darker than the ""Harry Potter"" series and seriously not intended for children.I even felt rather nerved while reading this book. And, while reading this book, one can forget that this is the same author who wrote the ""Harry Potter"" series, or so I think. Personally, it was really a struggle emotionally reading through this book as it has so much profanity and explicit imagery almost on every page. Admittedly, this book is not my favorite of her works, but it has some interesting pathological insights and shows the worst aspects of ourselves as I think it's a good portrayal to that respect.",4,"12 29, 2012",1356739200,"[1, 1]"
"0316228532","A2EECVV4L82JJE","Zagain","The Casual Vacancy","In the Casual Vacancy, Rowling turns her attention away from the wizard world of Harry Potter to the more adult focused small community of Pagford &#8211; where everyone knows everyone else.  The community is in the midst of a small civil war among its elected representatives as lines have been drawn between two sides who are debating whether or not the town should rid itself of the responsibility of a local housing project (called The Fields) and a connected drug treatment facility.  Readers of the Potter series will recognize Rowling's writing style in which she does an excellent job of handling multiple characters and weaving together several subplots in to the main direction of the novel.  Interestingly, there are some other parallels to her earlier work.  Like the Potter series which focused on a central dynamic figure, Harry, who the others rallied around, The Casual Vacancy has its own central player in Barry Fairbrother, the primary leader of the pro-Fields movement and an integral player in the lives of all the primary characters.  In an interesting twist, however (which is far from a spoiler), Barry dies suddenly in the first few pages of the novel, leaving the other characters to adapt and struggle with his absence.  While Barry departs the book early, his presence remains felt throughout the plot.  The elements of the book at times seem reminiscent of a soap opera with the various intrigues of the characters, however, it is an engaging story that is helped along by Rowling's solid style.  Overall, a good novel that falls a bit short of her previous (and astoundingly popular) works.",3,"12 20, 2013",1387497600,"[0, 0]"

He holds a seat on the Parish Board, where he is in the minority as a champion of The Fields. When Barry dies suddenly his Parish seat become available and the ugly face of small town politics is exposed as several community members vie for Barry&#8217;s seat.The novel moves between six separate family stories and initially it is difficult to differentiate them.  As the story progresses, however, we get to know the characters, just as a stranger gradually becomes familiar. The character&#8217;s stories are all intricately connected in one way or another through the empty Parish Board seat.I listened to the audio version of this book and absolutely loved it up until the very end at which time I was saddened by the dreary ending.

"0316228532","A1POFVVXUZR3IQ","Z Hayes","Difficult to get into, but has its moments","Although I am a great fan of the Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling, I knew that this was going to be very different just from all the synopses and reviews I read but I felt compelled to check it out anyway. I wanted to experience for myself how well Ms. Rowling transitions into the mature, grown-up fiction genre after having written so successfully for the Young Adult fantasy market (though the HP novels are ageless in that they appeal to readers of all ages).The beginning is a bit plodding. Set in a small English town called Pagford, the story focuses on what happens when Parish Councillor Barry Fairbrother dies. This sets a whole series of events into motion - the now empty seat is termed a casual vacancy, and needs to be filled. Several residents are keen to fill this seat for various purposes, some who shared Fairbrother's politics and some who were violently opposed to him. The disagreement has to do with The Fields, a local council estate which some residents of Pagford look down upon and do not wish to see their tax dollars fund services such as the addiction clinic.The first third of the story was frankly tedious because there are so many details given about the cast of characters (of which there are many) - disgruntled spouses, crack addicts, an abusive husband and father, teenagers from broken homes leading desperate lives, and people in unhappy relationships.The two words that kept popping into my head as I listened to this story (I also read it through once) were ""sad"" and ""desperate"" - so many of the characters are deeply dissatisfied with their lives and their relationships and the tone of the novel is for the most part depressing. There's also a theme of desperation that runs throughout the story - young people desperate for reprieve from abusive and unbearable family situations, a wife who is at her wits' end, a grieving widow, and many more. This is certainly not a story for those looking for something uplifting. I'd like to think I'm a mostly optimistic person, but this story had me despairing for the characters and feeling a sinking sense of hopelessness as the story advanced.To be fair, J.K. Rowling writes well, and Tom Hollander does a credible job on the audible version - she has the flair for bringing out the best and worst in her characters as she did so well in the Harry Potter series. Unfortunately, she also resorts to tedious, unwarranted descriptions in many parts of the story that I felt could have been better edited.Towards the end, I found myself surprisingly developing a real concern for some of the less fortunate characters, especially among the teenagers and found myself genuinely caring about what happened to some of them. The climactic ending was a great blow to the gut and visceral in its description. For that, I give this otherwise so-so story three stars.",3,"07 18, 2013",1374105600,"[1, 1]"

In the early pages I was turning back to refer to who was whom.  More than once I felt like giving up on the story, or worse, going straight to the back to see how it ended.  Very pleased I didn't in the end though.Long, drawn out sentences with unusual words, made me think more than once that JKR was trying to get her word count up.I had read other reviews before making my purchase, and didn't want to believe them, hoping I could add something more positive, which, sadly I can't.If you are into gossip and the sad way that people fill their daily lives, this book may be to your taste, but its not my preferred style.",1,"11 11, 2012",1352592000,"[0, 1]"

The adolescents, wounded and noble and confused, enjoy full humanity while the adult characters are predictable, boring, and soulless.  The theme seems to be a rant against materialism, racism, and class warfare in the English towns and villages, and some of the details and vocabulary probably resonate best with an English reader.  To my eye, however, this is an poor-to-average effort by a talented writer - a lack of nuance and sloppy character development.  Are we to conclude that anyone over the age of 19 does not deserve anything but cardboard cut-out development in a novel?  Odd.
